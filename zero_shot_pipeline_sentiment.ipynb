            "Despite dramatic differences in tactics, Carmichael, the SNCC, the Black Panthers, SDS, and Weatherman all understood one thing: the basis for political activism lies not in moral conviction or good intentions, but in socio-economic consciousness.  That is, real and effective politics stem from people acting in the recognition of their own structural self-interest.  For climate justice, such a re-articulation could open up a completely different set of tactical options.  Self-defense options.  As Belalia notes, “for many in this country, resistance isn’t a choice – it’s plain survival.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Tactically, the New Abolitionists have espoused a return to civil disobedience as an expression of their radicalism, their willingness to confront “public enemy number one” – the fossil fuel industry—in person and on the ground.   Certainly, this re-embrace of a set of tactics which has wrongfully acquired such a bad rap since the 1970s is refreshing and necessary, as well as an acknowledgement of the real work that continues to be done by a host of grassroots communities and organizations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yet how this commitment to civil disobedience has so far been expressed should occasion a wake-up call.  In August of 2011, some 1,200 prominent environmentalists, scientists, and professionals peacefully protested against the Keystone XL pipeline in front of the White House.  They were arrested and detained for refusing the order of the Washington, D.C. park police to disperse.  Why did these arrests garner sustained national media attention and widespread accolades? Stories about the hundreds of environmentalists who, outside of the Beltway, daily risk arrest by placing their bodies directly in the way of environmental destruction are mentioned sparingly, if ever.  Why exactly was it noteworthy and admirable for Gus Speth, an older professional environmentalist, to declare that he was willing to get arrested because he was “at the end of his rope”?8  Presumably the residents of Dimock, Pennsylvania and Houston’s East End have been living at the end of their proverbial ropes for much longer and with drastically more palpable consequences.  Particularly infuriating is Bill McKibben’s repeated insistence that the Keystone arrests were the largest act of civil disobedience in recent history.  This claim, which denies legitimacy to the large-scale and non-violent protests in Seattle (1999) and New York (2004), as well as to the Occupy encampments (2011-12), speaks to the limits of McKibben and others’ definition of civil disobedience.  When put into practice, the New Abolitionists’ embrace of “radicalism” and “civil disobedience” rings hollow in comparison with the principled militancy of the 1960s, and the ongoing direct actions of grassroots climate justice activists at actual sites of environmental destruction.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the New Abolitionists’ real desire is to escape association with the legacy of consumer-choice and compromise environmentalism, they would do well to join their truly radical counterparts by naming the elephant in the room: capitalism.  Such a direct naming is a necessary step towards clarifying their own allegiances.  To date, this direct naming has remained confined to the so-called “radical” environmentalists, such as Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front, Rising Tide, and Peaceful Uprising.  Not incidentally, these environmentalists are also those who already understand their activism as self-defense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most Americans recognize that they live in a radically unequal world.  Most realize that they are on the losing end of the equation.  So why have these people failed to see their struggles reflected in climate justice politics?  The workers sickened and killed from chemical exposure during the BP oil spill cleanup, residents of South Los Angeles whose children are inhale the emissions from gas extraction, or the residents of the Marcellus Shale whose water is undrinkable: why have these communities, each of whom is on the front-lines of environmental destruction in the United States, yet to join the ongoing struggle against climate change?\n",
            "\n",
            "Responsibility for the disconnect between local communities and the globally-focused climate justice movement lies squarely on the shoulders of those well-known climate change activists who have bypassed the human landscape which successful climate justice organizing must inhabit.  The self-imagination as New Abolitionists implies a selfless “speaking for” the masses that are unable to speak for themselves.  Yet this is manifestly not the case.  Local communities are completely able to speak for themselves: they simply do so in a different language.\n",
            "\n",
            "If their goal is to articulate the connection between the challenges faced by local communities and the global fight against climate change in a way that broad populations of dispossessed people hear and respond to, the New Abolitionists need to radically recalibrate their approach.  The first step will be to truly ally with grassroots climate justice activists, by stepping out of the limelight to lockdown on the Keystone pipeline or staging a sit-in at TD Bank to protest its continued funding of the pipeline.  In this regard, the radical leftist politics of the 1960s illuminate a structural critique of oppression that recognizes the differential burdens placed by manmade climate change on the poor and non-white populations of the world.  Moreover, they suggest how a clear understanding of structural inequality leads directly to a praxis of self-defense.\n",

Yet I’m seeing that the people in charge and the people who are running our country aren’t doing anything. To me this is confusing. So I’m here today to step up and say, ‘No more!’” “This is your first climate rally. [cheering] And let’s all strike. I said that this was just the beginning, that we would keep striking, keep taking action and do everything we could to avert this crisis. And today shows that we have followed through with that promise. And we will never back down.”\n",

If no one else will take action, then we will,” Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist whose one-person strikes in Stockholm helped ignite a global movement, told demonstrators in New York City. “We demand a safe future. Is that really too much to ask?”\n",
            "\n",
            "Whether this global action solves the problem that the protesters have identified — arresting greenhouse gas emissions to stave off a climate catastrophe — now depends on how effectively climate advocates can turn Friday’s momentum into sustained political pressure on governments and companies that produce those emissions.\n",

            "This article presents an overview of the history of international climate change policy over the last 30 years, divided into five periods. It examines the pre-1990 period, the period leading up to the adoption of the Climate Change Convention, the period of the Kyoto Protocol until US withdrawal, the period thereafter focusing on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, and the post-2008 period that coincides with the financial crisis. For each period, it discusses the relevant science, actors, and coalitions, the agreements emerging in that period, and the key issues and the major trends. In doing so, it examines the evolving articulation of the leadership paradigm, which is the centerpiece of the discussion on how climate change should be addressed. The article shows (1) the increasing complexity of the definition of the climate change issue from an environmental to a development issue; (2) the inability of the developed countries to reduce their own emissions and raise funds commensurate with the nature of the problem and their initial commitments; (3) the increasing engagement of different social actors in the discussion and, in particular, the gradual use of market mechanisms in the regime; (4) the increasing search for alternative solutions within the formal negotiations—such as the identification of nationally appropriate mitigation actions for the developing world, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the use of geo-engineering solutions; and (5) the search for solutions outside the regime—the mobilization of sub-national policies on climate change, litigation, and markets on biofuels.

            "The establishment of the IPCC was endorsed by UN General Assembly in 1988. Its initial task, as outlined in UN General Assembly Resolution 43/53 of 6 December 1988, was to prepare a comprehensive review and recommendations with respect to the state of knowledge of the science of climate change; the social and economic impact of climate change, and potential response strategies and elements for inclusion in a possible future international convention on climate. Since 1988, the IPCC has had five assessment cycles and delivered five Assessment Reports, the most comprehensive scientific reports about climate change produced worldwide. It has also produced a range of Methodology Reports, Special Reports and Technical Papers, in response to requests for information on specific scientific and technical matters from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), governments and international organizations.\n",

            "In 1990, the First IPCC Assessment Report (FAR) underlined the importance of climate change as a challenge with global consequences and requiring international cooperation. It played a decisive role in the creation of the UNFCCC, the key international treaty to reduce global warming and cope with the consequences of climate change. The Second Assessment Report (SAR) (1995) provided important material for governments to draw from in the run-up to adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) (2001) focused attention on the impacts of climate change and the need for adaptation. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (2007) laid the ground work for a post-Kyoto agreement, focusing on limiting warming to 2°C. The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was finalized between 2013 and 2014. It provided the scientific input into the Paris Agreement. The IPCC is currently in its Sixth Assessment cycle where it will prepare three Special Reports, a Methodology Report and the Sixth Assessment Report. The first of these Special Reports, Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15), was requested by world governments under the Paris Agreement. In May 2019, the IPCC finalised the 2019 Refinement – an update to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) will be finalized in August 2019 and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) will be finalized in September 2019.

            "\n",
            "The experience has been cited since as a textbook example of how not to introduce a carbon tax, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar telling the Dáil in November the Government was conscious of what happened in Australia which he said had set that country back 20 years.\n",
            "\n",

            "To offset the impact of the tax, Labor reduced income tax and increased welfare payments to cover expected price increases. It also introduced compensation for some affected industries.

Then prime minister Tony Abbott said getting rid of the tax would save people $550 (€485) a year. This figure was widely disputed, but electricity and gas prices did fall by an estimated 7 and 5 per cent respectively. But Australia’s emissions went up again. With 0.3 per cent of the world’s population, it produces 1.8 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases.

            "The action, which came on the first day possible under the accord’s complex rules on withdrawal, begins a yearlong countdown to the United States exit and a concerted effort to preserve the Paris Agreement, under which nearly 200 nations have pledged to cut greenhouse emissions and to help poor countries cope with the worst effects of an already warming planet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the notification on Twitter and issued a statement saying the accord would impose intolerable burdens on the American economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The U.S. approach incorporates the reality of the global energy mix and uses all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently, including fossils fuels, nuclear energy, and renewable energy,” Mr. Pompeo said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though American participation in the Paris Agreement will ultimately be determined by the outcome of the 2020 election, supporters of the pact say they have to plan for a future without American cooperation. And diplomats fear that Mr. Trump, who has mocked climate science as a hoax, will begin actively working against global efforts to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keeping up the pressure for the kinds of economic change necessary to stave off the worse effects of planetary warming will be much harder without the world’s superpower.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Yes, there are conversations. It would be crazy not to have them,” Laurence Tubiana, who served as France’s climate change ambassador during the Paris negotiations, said in New York recently, adding, “We are preparing for Plan B.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Negotiators spent the early months of the Trump presidency debating strategies for salvaging American support for the accord. Mr. Trump proved immovable.\n",
            "\n",
            "President Trump had long held that the accord would cripple growth and intrude on American sovereignty. “It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; and Pittsburgh, Pa., along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France,” he said in 2017 when he announced that the United States would withdraw from the accord.\n",
            "\n",
            "Around the world, a shift in diplomatic strategy has already begun. Making the accord work without the United States will require other major polluters like China and India to step up. China, now the largest emitter of planet-warming pollutants, has made significant promises but Beijing’s ability to deliver is still in question.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under United Nations rules, China and India are considered developing countries and are not obligated to curb emissions. They agreed to do so as part of the Paris Agreement in large part because the United States was taking action. With the United States out, other industrialized nations will have to press those emerging powers.\n",
            "\n",
            "The European Union held high-level meetings last year in Beijing to confirm the Paris commitment of both the European bloc and China. It also has provided millions of dollars to aid Chinese emissions-control efforts and worked with Canada and other countries to coordinate standards for trillions of dollars of private and public financial investment in clean energy technologies.\n",
            "\n",
            "But so far China has resisted pledging to speed up its initial emissions-control targets, which foresee greenhouse gas emissions rising until 2030. Europe, which is divided itself over how far to scale back coal power, may not have the clout to win new concessions.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The E.U. is the front line out here. That’s very obvious,” the president of Finland, Sauli Niinisto, said in a recent interview. “The question is, will others listen to Europe?”\n",
            "\n",
            "Some nations are considering more punitive measures. France and Germany this year proposed a European carbon tax to impose on countries with less stringent climate protection policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The fact is that we may find the first conflict could come with the United States, and I think that should not be something desirable for anyone,” said Teresa Ribera, minister for the ecological transition of Spain, which is hosting United Nations climate talks in December.\n",
            "\n",
            "A European tax on goods imported from the United States would be certain to exacerbate trade tensions with the Trump administration. But Europe has been threatening such a tax for years and, so far, has not followed through.\n",

            "“We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters,” he said. “Just as we have in the past, the United States will continue to research, innovate, and grow our economy while reducing emissions and extending a helping hand to our friends and partners around the globe,” he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "While no other nation has followed Mr. Trump’s lead and left the Paris Agreement — indeed, more countries have joined — few are toughening their emissions-reduction targets. Analysts attributed that to the absence of pressure from the United States and they warned that the Trump administration’s antagonism toward climate action could dampen future ambitions.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Because the community was caught flat-footed by 2016, we want to be in a position to be prepared this time,” said Elan Strait, a former climate negotiator in the Obama administration who worked on the Paris Agreement and who now works at the World Wildlife Fund.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the United States, environmentalists are pressing states, cities and businesses to cut emissions and move to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Hundreds of local governments and businesses have made emissions pledges under a movement called We Are Still In, which hopes to show the world that Americans are behind the Paris Agreement even if the administration is not.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those so-called sub-national government pledges are voluntary, and there is no agreed-upon way to calculate how far their efforts are collectively getting toward President Barack Obama’s pledge to cut emissions about 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Cities, states, and businesses haven’t had a formal place at the negotiating table, but the Paris Agreement succeeded in large part because their voices were heard, and they will keep us moving forward until we have a president who will confront the climate crisis and put the public’s health and safety first,” Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire philanthropist and former mayor of New York City, said in a statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Bloomberg has started America’s Pledge, an initiative to track efforts by United States cities, states, and businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On Monday he also announced that mayors, governors, chief executive officers and environmental leaders would host a “U.S. Climate Action Center” at the next round of climate negotiations to assume the role the American delegation would have played.\n",
            "\n",
            "Such efforts are expanding internationally. While the Paris Agreement focused on national governments, Ms. Tubiana said the actions of states, provinces, businesses and others were driving some of the most concrete changes. The challenge, she said, would be devising ways to turn all of those pledges into a system that can chip away at global emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The letter to the United Nations on Monday would allow Mr. Trump to officially pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement the day after the presidential election. The United States would still be allowed to attend negotiations and weigh in on proceedings but would be downgraded to observer status.\n",
            "\n",
            "Analysts cautioned that even if the United States elects a Democrat in 2020, re-entry will not necessarily go smoothly. The Paris Agreement is the second global climate change pact that the United States joined under a Democrat and abandoned under a Republican. George W. Bush withdrew the United States from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jonathan Pershing, who served during the Obama administration as the State Department’s special envoy for climate change, said a Democrat rejoining the Paris Agreement would likely be expected to deliver a specific suite of policies showing how the United States intended to move away from fossil fuels. Even then, he said, other countries would be rightly wary that the pendulum of support for climate action could swing back in another election cycle. The United States will have to live with that lingering mistrust, Mr. Pershing said.\n",

            "For the first time in the survey’s two-decade history, a majority of Americans said dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress. That’s a 14 percentage point rise from four years ago.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nearly two-thirds of Americans ranked protecting the environment as a leading policy priority, which is almost as many as said economic growth should remain a primary focus.\n",

            "Addressing climate change has become more urgent for Democrats in recent years, with 78 percent calling it a top policy priority in 2020. But Republicans have, by and large, remained unmoved.\n",
            "\n",
            "The partisan gap over climate change was the widest to date in 2020 and the most yawning among 18 issues covered by the survey. Protecting the environment, including air and water quality, was the second most divisive issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Intense partisan polarization over these two issues in particular” has been growing for decades, said Riley Dunlap, a professor emeritus at Oklahoma State University who studies trends in public opinion on environmental topics. Political messaging from party leaders and the media has been a major driver of the divide, he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Voters take cues on their policy preferences and overall positions,” Dr. Dunlap said. “President Trump has, in the past, called climate change a hoax and all that.

            "\n",
            "The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has made combating climate change a more central focus in recent years. All eight presidential hopefuls still vying for the party’s 2020 nomination support drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, and most have issued detailed climate action plans.\n",

            "Seeking to provide a counter-narrative, House Republicans introduced their own climate agenda last week, which included a plan to plant one trillion trees by 2050.

In the scientific realm, global warming refers to the overall pattern of increased warming of the earth's atmosphere over the past century and a half, while climate change refers to the changing climatic conditions that result from this warming. However, in the public and media spheres, the two are used interchangeably. Gallup continues to use global warming in order to enhance comparisons over time. In addition, results from Gallup's 2014 environment poll and an April 2014 tracking poll both indicate that the two terms elicit very similar responses overall and in terms of partisan differences.

For Figures 2–7, “Republican” and “lean to Republican” responses and “Democrat” and “lean to Democratic” responses are combined, and in subsequent statistical analyses party is coded into Republican, Independent, and Democrat.

            "Last week, the Trump administration announced it will begin the legal process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement. This symbolic move will have little impact. Whether the world reduces carbon emissions matters far more than whether the United States remains part of the agreement. The agreement was designed to tolerate noncooperation. While some observers worry that nations will tackle climate change only if everyone else does, too, the empirical record suggests otherwise. Right now, other nations are acting to reduce emissions. A Trump administration withdrawal will irritate other countries but won’t derail global action.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under the Paris agreement, nations set their own goals, making pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as they see fit. This is a direct response to the failures of the Kyoto Protocol, which required developed nations to cut their emissions according to a rigorous set of targets and timetables. The United States did not join the Kyoto Protocol, and major emitters such as Canada and Australia either withdrew or did not sign on to its continuation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paris agreement, by contrast, offers a flexible framework that requires all nations to take some action on climate change, however minimal, with the expectation that they will ratchet up their ambitions over time. Given that each country gets to make its own rules, President Trump’s lamentation that the agreement is “unfair” demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of its design. This decentralized approach, emphasizing national and subnational action, means that climate policy can be tailored to domestic economic concerns and political constraints. This increases the likelihood that governments will make national pledges they can actually keep — or so the logic goes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The problem, therefore, is not who participates, or doesn’t, but rather how ambitious nations’ pledges to reduce emissions actually are. Right now, if all countries actually implement their national pledges under the agreement, the mean global temperature will rise by 3 degrees Celsius, or about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit. This is far higher than the goal set in the Paris agreement to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paris agreement has served as a convenient target for the Trump administration, but the reality is the United States is the worst offender when it comes to global emissions. Historically, it is the largest emitter, responsible for about one-third of total emissions, and its per capita emissions are roughly twice as large as those of the next largest emitter. Many, including Trump, point to China’s emissions as a reason for inaction. But China overtook the United States as the world’s biggest emitter only in 2005, though some of these emissions are to produce exports for the United States and the European Union.\n",
            "\n",
            "The damage is not just historical. Since 2016, the Trump administration has steadily eviscerated federal climate policy. It repealed President Barack Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, and replaced it with new regulations that could increase emissions. It has also weakened fuel economy standards, which will also raise emissions — against the wishes of much of the auto industry. It’s trying to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waiver, which allows California to set air quality standards that are more demanding than federal rules. If the administration succeeds, that will probably increase emissions while reducing the use of electric vehicles. Previous research suggests such a move will not only affect California but have ripple effects through the U.S. economy. In short, the United States’ actual policy changes are more important than its moves to withdraw from the Paris agreement.\n",
            "\n",
            "Governments around the world are preparing for yet another round of climate negotiations — in Chile in December. Meanwhile, within the United States, cities, states and businesses insist that “we are still in,” despite the looming federal withdrawal from the Paris agreement in 2018. A number of U.S. cities and states have set their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, New York state passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which sets one of the world’s most ambitious climate goals, pledging that by 2050 it will reduce carbon emissions to 85 percent below 1990 levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "Such efforts are making some progress toward emissions reductions; the U.N. Environment Program estimates that current efforts are reducing about 0.5 gigatons of CO2 (in 2018, the world emitted roughly 37 gigatons). One environmental group estimates that these commitments add up to about two-thirds of the U.S. pledge made as part of the Paris agreement. Still, the United States will not get there, much less achieve net-zero carbon emissions, unless the federal government gets involved.\n",
            "\n",
            "Discussions of a Green New Deal could play a critical role in changing federal policy. This congressional resolution, proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), aims to decarbonize the U.S. economy while reducing income inequality and expanding the social safety net. Though climate change has traditionally been a polarizing topic in the United States, at least some polls suggest public support for a Green New Deal is overcoming this divide.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paris agreement would survive a U.S. withdrawal. But the tougher political questions are: How quickly can carbon emissions be removed from the U.S. economy, and can climate and justice advocates, working with elected officials, build enough political support to do that?\n",

            "This chapter explores why, despite international legislation, gender mainstreaming has failed to be integrated into climate change related decision-making, and also outlines critiques of gender mainstreaming. It then discusses the UK evidence from three research projects undertaken by the authors over the course of twelve years. The earliest research project investigated how municipal waste management was gendered in three EU member states. It was funded in 2002 by the European Commission as a pilot project in gender mainstreaming. The second research project, started in 2006, was undertaken in Turkey and the UK for the award of a PhD and investigated how environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) are gendered. The third piece of research was undertaken in connection with a European Union COST Action on Gender and Science, Technology and Environment, and comprised interviews with managers and women's network coordinators in three UK government departments/quangos with a climate change remit. The chapter scrutinizes a selection of equality impact assessments of energy policies.\n",

            "In the midst of the current international debate on global warming, it is instructive to note that it has taken the United Nations and the international community some two generations to reach this point.To fully understand the current debate, one must look at the rise in prominence of environmental issues on the global agenda and the evolution of climate change within that context. Environmental issues, much less climate change, were not a major concern of the United Nations in the period following the Organization's creation. During its first 23 years, action on these issues was limited to operational activities, mainly through the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and when attention was paid to them, it was within the context of one of the major preoccupations of that time: the adequacy of known natural resources to provide for the economic development of a large number of UN members or the \"underdeveloped countries\", as they were then termed.In 1949, the UN Scientific Conference on the conservation and utilization of resources (Lake Success, New York, 17 August to 6 September) was the first UN body to address the depletion of those resources and their use. The focus, however, was mainly on how to manage them for economic and social development, and not from a conservation perspective. It was not until 1968 that environmental issues received serious attention by any major UN organs. The Economic and Social Council on 29 May was the first to include those issues in its agenda as a specific item and decided -- later endorsed by the General Assembly -- to hold the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.Held in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972, the UN Scientific Conference, also known as the First Earth Summit, adopted a declaration that set out principles for the preservation and enhancement of the human environment, and an action plan containing recommendations for international environmental action. In a section on the identification and control of pollutants of broad international significance, the Declaration raised the issue of climate change for the first time, warning Governments to be mindful of activities that could lead to climate change and evaluate the likelihood and magnitude of climatic effects.The UN Scientific Conference also proposed the establishment of stations to monitor long-term trends in the atmospheric constituents and properties, which might cause meteorological properties, including climatic changes. Those programmes were to be coordinated by WMO to help the world community to better understand the atmosphere and the causes of climatic changes, whether natural or the result of man's activities. The Conference also called for the convening of a second meeting on the environment and established the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with its secretariat in Nairobi, Kenya, the Environment Fund and the Environment Coordination Board. But climate change did not become a central preoccupation of those bodies. Water resources, marine mammals, renewable energy resources, desertification, forests, environmental legal framework and the issue of environment and development took centre stage.Over the next 20 years, as part of efforts to implement the 1972 decisions, concern for the atmosphere and global climate slowly gained international attention and action. In 1979, the UNEP Governing Council asked its Executive Director, under the Earth Watch programme, to monitor and evaluate the long-range transport of air pollutants, and the first international instrument on climate -- the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution -- was then adopted. UNEP took it to another level in 1980, when its Governing Council expressed concern at the damage to the ozone layer and recommended measures to limit the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons F-11and F-12. This led to the negotiation and adoption in 1985 of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the conclusion of a Protocol to the 1979 Transboundary Air Pollution Convention, which aimed at reducing sulphur emissions by 30 per cent. In the meantime, palpable evidence of climate change due to air pollution was beginning to emerge in the phenomena of acid rain in Europe and North America, which resulted in various programmes by UNEP and WMO for keeping it in check.However, in 1987 the UN General Assembly gave real impetus to environmental issues, when it adopted the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond -- a framework to guide national action and international cooperation on policies and programmes aimed at achieving environmentally sound development. The Perspective underlined the relationship between environment and development and for the first time introduced the notion of sustainable development. It was disappointing, however, that such a long-term policy document, while recognizing the need for clean air technologies and to control air pollution, did not make climate change a central issue, but subsumed it under its policy directive related to energy.In 1988, global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer became increasingly prominent in the international public debate and political agenda. UNEP organized an internal seminar in January to identify environmental sectors that might be sensitive to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a forum for the examination of greenhouse warming and global climate change, was established and met for the first time in November. The General Assembly identified climate change as a specific and urgent issue. In its resolution on the protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind, it asked WMO and UNEP to initiate a comprehensive review and make recommendations on climate change, including possible response strategies to delay, limit or mitigate the impact of climate change. As a result, 1989 was a watershed year for climate change, as the first significant global efforts were taken. The Assembly, in resolution 44/207, endorsed the UNEP Governing Council's request to begin preparations with WMO for negotiations on a framework convention on climate change; regional action was also being taken. In addition, the Maldives transmitted the text of the Malé Declaration on Global Warming and Sea Level Rise to the UN Secretary-General and the Helsinki Declaration on the Protection of the Ozone Layer was adopted on 2 May. Also in 1989, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force.Efforts to raise awareness of the effects of climate changes were further advanced at the second World Climate Conference, held from 29 October to 7 November 1990. In its Ministerial Declaration, the Conference stated that climate change was a global problem of unique character for which a global response was required. It called for negotiations to begin on a framework convention without further delay. As the urgency for a stronger international action on the environment, including climate change, gained momentum, the General Assembly decided to convene in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The Earth Summit, as it is also known, set a new framework for seeking international agreements to protect the integrity of the global environment in its Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, which reflected a global consensus on development and environmental cooperation. Chapter 9 of Agenda 21 dealt with the protection of the atmosphere, establishing the link between science, sustainable development, energy development and consumption, transportation, industrial development, stratospheric ozone depletion and transboundary atmospheric pollution.aThe most significant event during the Conference was the opening for signature of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); by the end of 1992, 158 States had signed it. As the most important international action thus far on climate change, the Convention was to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of \"greenhouse gases\" at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. It entered into force in 1994, and in March 1995, the first Conference of the Parties to the Convention adopted the Berlin Mandate, launching talks on a protocol or other legal instrument containing stronger commitments for developed countries and those in transition.The cornerstone of the climate change action was, therefore, the adoption in Japan in December 1997 of the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, the most influential climate change action so far taken. It aimed to reduce the industrialized countries' overall emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by at least 5 per cent below the 1990 levels in the commitment period of 2008 to 2012. The Protocol, which opened for signature in March 1998, came into force on 16 February 2005, seven years after it was negotiated by over 160 nations.Once again, the United Nations has shown its leadership role in bringing issues requiring global action to international attention. However, its efforts throughout the years to make the issue of climate change a central focus of the international agenda continues, even as opposing sides of the debate try to make their case. As evidence of the risks of ignoring climate change become more striking, the United Nations will persevere in that effort until the issue is embraced by all.\n",

It took nearly a century of research and data to convince the vast majority of the scientific community that human activity could alter the climate of our entire planet. In the 1800s, experiments suggesting that human-produced carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases could collect in the atmosphere and insulate Earth were met with more curiosity than concern. By the late 1950s, CO2 readings would offer some of the first data to corroborate the global warming theory. Eventually an abundance of data, along with climate modeling would show not only that global warming was real, but that it also presented a host of dire consequences.\n",

            "Experts have since pointed out that the greenhouse analogy was an oversimplification, since outgoing infrared radiation isn’t exactly trapped by Earth’s atmosphere but absorbed. The more greenhouse gases there are, the more energy is kept within Earth’s atmosphere.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the so-called greenhouse effect analogy stuck and some 40 years later, Irish scientist John Tyndall would start to explore exactly what kinds of gases were most likely to play a role in absorbing sunlight.\n",

            "Tyndall’s laboratory tests in the 1860s showed that coal gas (containing CO2, methane and volatile hydrocarbons) was especially effective at absorbing energy. He eventually demonstrated that CO2 alone acted like sponge in the way it could absorb multiple wavelengths of sunlight.\n",

            "By 1895, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius became curious about how decreasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere might cool Earth. In order to explain past ice ages, he wondered if a decrease in volcanic activity might lower global CO2 levels. His calculations showed that if CO2 levels were halved, global temperatures could decrease by about 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit).\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, Arrhenius wondered if the reverse were true. Arrhenius returned to his calculations, this time investigating what would happen if CO2 levels were doubled. The possibility seemed remote at the time, but his results suggested that global temperatures would increase by the same amount—5 degrees C or 9 degrees F.\n",
            "\n",
            "As Arrehenius wrote, “By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid [CO2] in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth.”\n",
            "\n",
            "By the 1930s, at least one scientist would start to claim that carbon emissions might already be having a warming effect.

            "\n",
            "Callendar’s calculations suggested that a doubling of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere could warm Earth by 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F). He would continue to argue into the 1960s that a greenhouse-effect warming of the planet was underway.\n",
            "\n",
            "While Callendar’s claims were largely met with skepticism, he managed to draw attention to the possibility of global warming. That attention played a part in garnering some of the first government-funded projects to more closely monitor climate and CO2 levels.\n",

It had to be organized by the federal government — that’s what the Clean Air Act of 1970 did. What the Clean Air Act did was to begin to require reductions, not in the CO2 because that wasn’t the target, but in the nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, which were responsible for the smog in L.A. A catalytic converter needed to be put in new automobiles, but the automobile industry had been using it in factories to reduce emissions, so it wasn’t a huge leap.

This reality was recognized by the Paris Agreement, which specifically included the global need to further empower women in climate decision-making. Today, across the world, from boardrooms and policy positions to local communities, from science to activism, women everywhere are using their voices to take leadership and call for action on climate change.\n",

Just five months earlier, the world failed to reach an agreement at the 2009 Copenhagen summit. She injected a unique sense of optimism, attempting to remove the talks from what she calls “the political trash can.” It worked: Figueres successfully steered world leaders to reach the Paris Agreement in 2015. Along with a number of other women involved in the negotiations, Figueres was successful in shedding an important light on the gender dimension of climate change. She’s now writing a book about what the world needs to do in the next 10 years to combat climate change. —Jennifer Duggan\n",

Heine has taken to the international stage to share the story of her country and the difficult decisions her compatriots are facing, including the possibility of relocating. She chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of some 50 countries particularly in peril from climate change, despite having contributed a pittance to atmospheric greenhouse gases.

A court in the Hague had ruled in favor of some 900 Dutch citizens and a group known as the Urgenda Foundation, which had sued the Netherlands, demanding that the state reduce its greenhouse–gas emissions. Khan realized the courts could be a powerful tool to fight climate change and in the process mitigate what she calls “one of the biggest systemic threats” to international human rights. She moved to London and joined Urgenda, where she now provides legal assistance to people around the world who want to take their governments to court over inadequate climate policies.

Page channeled her anger into a new documentary based on Waldron’s work (and sharing its title), which examines the health impacts of environmental racism and the resistance efforts of affected communities. In the film, Page returns to Nova Scotia and talks to women leading the charge to restore their communities.

Simpson should know. Her employer ranks among the world’s largest public funds, and she has used the sway that comes with -CalPERS’ more than $350 billion in investments to urge change. Early victories include pushing some of the world’s biggest companies to disclose the risk climate change poses to their businesses. To extend her reach, Simpson helps lead Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative to engage in behind-the-scenes negotiations to demand the world’s 100 biggest greenhouse—gas emitters change their ways. It’s prompted companies like mining giant Glencore to cap coal production and oil-and-gas major Shell to commit to emission-reduction targets.

Young people across the world have followed her path, striking and marching to make clear to adults and decision-makers that this is a true emergency. “We are children saying, ‘Why should we care about our future when no one else is doing that? And why should we bother to learn facts when facts don’t matter in this society?’ When children say something like that, I think adults feel very bad,” Thunberg told TIME in April.

            "There's a tense scene in Eric Pooley's The Climate War when Jim Rogers, CEO of coal utility Duke Energy and leader of a shaky coalition of power companies, faces a moment of truth. Ten Fortune 500 companies and four major environmental groups are at the table. They've got a statement of legislative principles they can agree on and are ready to throw their collective weight behind a long-overdue comprehensive climate-change bill in the United States. They just need his sign-off. For Rogers, under intense pressure from his industry's biggest polluters, it amounts to a career-risking leap into the dark.\n",

            "It's a moment of genuine drama, one of many in a book that might seem unlikely to have any dramatic tension given that its subject is a decades-long stretch of conferences, meetings, and PowerPoint presentations. From this florescent-lit raw material, Pooley weaves the kind of propulsive potboiler political junkies love to read. It does for the U.S. pursuit of a climate bill what Game Change did for the 2008 campaign: It thrusts readers behind the scenes at a crossroads in history.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Pooley's book doesn't end with an unlikely triumph. It doesn't end with a fateful failure. It doesn't really end at all, so much as ... stop. It builds to a crescendo that never arrives. The international climate summit in Copenhagen, heralded by environmentalists as the world's last, best hope, failed to produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol and petered out in a voluntary bits-and-bobs accord. Stateside, momentum behind a climate bill ground to a halt in that burial ground of all hope and aspiration, the U.S. Senate (a story told in sordid detail by Ryan Lizza in The New Yorker last October).\n",

            "According to David Victor's new book, Global Warming Gridlock, the problem runs much deeper. In fact, climate negotiators are operating under the influence of a series of myths and misunderstandings that doom their strategy to perpetual failure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Victor, a political scientist who directs the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego, is a bit of a climate Zelig. For two decades, he's been popping up everywhere, leading study groups, working as a consultant to governments and businesses, and serving on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He has seen firsthand the failure to make substantial progress on climate policy, and he's been taking notes.\n",
            "\n",
            "There's ample reason for alarm about climate change. The odds of catastrophic impacts rise with each day of delay, yet the status quo has inertia and powerful interests on its side. A problem so terrible, so intractable, seems to call for a response of commensurate size and force. As Victor tells it, however, that sense of desperate urgency felt by climate scientists and campaigners is precisely what's led to their undoing.\n",
            "\n",
            "The quest for a grand solution follows a three-step process. First, scientists determine how much warming is too much and draw a \"red line.\" Today, that line is typically presented as 2 degrees Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels, the official target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the G-8. Second, they determine the level of emission reductions necessary to avoid the red line. Third, diplomats bring the world's countries together to sign a collective treaty pledging to achieve those reductions.\n",
            "\n",
            "This top-down strategy is seductive, which is why it's been central to international climate negotiations since the signing of the Rio Declaration in 1992. But as a practical matter, it's not working. There have been summits, dialogues, symposia, and great, gushing torrents of talk, but climate-warming emissions have continued their inexorable upward trajectory. Climate diplomacy has yielded \"the illusion of action but not much impact on the underlying problem,\" Victor writes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The strategy fails because it is driven by persistent misunderstandings about how nation-states interact with the international community. First is what Victor calls the scientist's myth, the idea that a clearer, stronger, louder scientific consensus about what level of warming is dangerous will change politics. But national leaders have overwhelming incentives to focus on their countries' short-term welfare, not on global dangers. \"Most of these line-drawing efforts,\" he notes, \"have very little real impact on policy.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Second is the environmentalist's myth that climate change is an \"environmental problem,\" best addressed by treaties establishing targets and timetables for the reduction of harmful emissions. That model has worked for other environmental problems, most notably the Montreal Protocol reducing ozone-damaging chemicals, but it is badly suited to climate change, which is better seen as a problem of economics, infrastructure, and innovation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, there's the engineer's myth, which holds that climate change will be easy to tackle because inventors will develop new technologies to lower the cost of reducing pollution. Thus the alluring appeal of technological \"breakthroughs.\" The engineer's myth \"obscures the wide array of factors that determine the rate at which new technologies actually enter into service,\" Victor says. Those factors include research and development, early-stage financing, and market barriers and opportunities.\n",
            "\n",
            "All these myths push strategy toward broad treaties built around pollution targets and timetables. If that strategy cannot succeed, what strategy can? It begins, Victor argues, \"by slowing down and refocusing on fundamentals,\" namely national interests and capabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Above all, he says, climate campaigners must abandon their scientism and take emission-reduction targets off center stage. National leaders cannot credibly promise particular emission levels in the short- to midterm. Emissions are determined by too many forces outside governmental control, including fossil-fuel prices, trade, and the pace of economic growth. The focus on targets is an invitation to empty grandstanding and lowest-common-denominator agreements. What leaders can credibly promise are policies, and policies, not numerical targets, should be at the center of climate accords, Victor argues.\n",
            "\n",
            "Policies of any ambition are best coordinated among a bounded group of participants. By requiring unanimous consent among 193 participating countries, the UNFCCC process effectively guarantees treaties that reflect the lowest bid of its least ambitious members. Yet there is no substantive reason to require the involvement of every single country. After all, the top dozen emitters (counting the European Union as a single emitter) account for 74 percent of global emissions from fossil fuels. To make the size of the negotiating table more tractable, Victor suggests a \"carbon club\" along the lines of the World Trade Organization. Members would \"bid in\" with policies geared to their own national circumstances and, crucially, add contingent offers predicated on action from other members. Within the club, those contingent offers and shared benefits would create a virtuous cycle. Meanwhile, the club would craft smart incentives to lure in new members. (The Clean Development Mechanism -- Kyoto's main way of offering \"carrots\" to developing countries for emission reductions -- has proved largely ineffectual.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Even if countries do begin moving forward, changes of the scale required are going to be more difficult, expensive, and protracted than most climate hawks believe, Victor warns. When economists model the costs of addressing climate change, they frequently assume market-based policies like a carbon tax that distribute costs in a fair and transparent way. But precisely because such policies are up-front about costs, they tend to be politically unpopular. \"The basic logic of good economic design is fungibility and transparency,\" Victor notes ruefully. \"The basic logic of politics encourages the hiding and channeling of costs and benefits.\" Politically powerful constituencies will organize to capture more than their share of benefits and avoid their share of the costs. That pushes politicians toward policies like direct regulation that impose higher net costs but hide those costs better and therefore elicit less blowback. \"Political forces strongly favor policy choices that are exactly reverse the advice of expert economists,\" Victor writes, thus the cost of tackling climate change is likely to be higher than economists project.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, driving down costs via new technology is no simple matter either, the engineer's myth notwithstanding. For decades, energy has been one of the least innovative sectors of the economy. Crafting an innovation system that drives technologies from basic-science research and development through early-stage funding and sustainable business enterprise will require smart, active government and lots of money. Most of all, it will take time to ramp up the effort.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the picture Victor paints of progress is accurate -- bottom-up, halting, and slow -- one unsettling conclusion is unavoidable: 2 degrees is probably already out of reach. Substantial climate change is already \"in the pipeline,\" and further deterioration is all but inevitable. Consequently, the international community needs to get much more serious about adaptation and, in the event of climate emergencies, the fallback option of geo-engineering.\n",
            "\n",
            "Adaptation has played a large role in the international discussion, but Victor argues that the climate community is unduly focused on the creation of a large adaptation fund for vulnerable developing countries. Preparing for and responding to climate changes are not discrete activities; they are largely coterminous with economic development more broadly. The strong institutions that societies will need to coordinate climate response are the same ones that yield economic growth and security. \"Mainstreaming adaptation into traditional well-managed development assistance is probably the most effective and moral strategy,\" he says. However, just as providing effective economic-development assistance has been challenging, so it is with adaptation funding. The unpleasant truth is that there's probably not a great deal rich countries can do to help poor ones prepare for climate change, no matter how well-meaning the wealthy nations may be. The economic and institutional reforms that yield development and resilience tend to arise from inside a country, not outside.\n",
            "\n",
            "The weight of all this grim and unsentimental counsel from Victor can be difficult to take, especially as it's written in a form something like the opposite of a potboiler. Unlike Pooley's tome, Victor's has no narrative, no human drama, only careful, painstaking, left-brain analysis that reads like an elaborate outline come to life. Each category has subcategories, each chart has quadrants. Occasionally, the quadrants have quadrants. This is a book for policy nerds, albeit a book with far more grounding in political science than the typical wonk tome.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's hard to argue with Victor's basic thrust -- the world of climate advocacy and diplomacy is long overdue for a heavy dose of realpolitik -- but in his zeal to contrast his new approach with the old, Victor passes too lightly over promising trends already moving in his direction.\n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, the notion that smaller groups than the UNFCCC are needed for serious climate negotiations is now practically conventional wisdom in developed countries. Climate has moved to the center of discussion at the G-8 and the Major Economies Forum. A treaty composed of policy commitments based on national interests and capabilities? Well, that's what the Copenhagen Accord turned out to be, if more by default than design, and that's almost certainly what any future international agreement will look like.\n",
            "\n",
            "Victor laments the difficulties of innovating around giant, capital-intensive energy projects. Then, almost as an aside, he notes the possibility \"that in the future the energy industry -- steeped in smart grids, 'plug and play' electric technologies, advanced biofuels and other innovations -- will look a lot like today's biotechnology and information technology industries\" -- that is, distributed, small-scale, fast, and low-risk. In fact, such a transformation is already under way and, more to the point, could be accelerated by smart policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "For all the quibbles, though, Victor's book almost certainly provides a more honest picture of the barriers to tackling climate change than the kind of romantic narrative offered by Pooley and other political journalists. After 20 years, it may be time to admit that the climate movement's fundamental strategy, not a deficit of personal courage or heroic striving, is behind the lack of progress. If the movement is to rise to its historic challenge, it will have to do so by working with nation-states as they actually exist.\n",

            "Conserve and restore habitats.Businesses can shrink their carbon footprints by ensuring that the making of their product does not involve cutting down forests or destroying habitats as it moves from source to market. Farmers and ranchers can also use climate-smart methods—like planting cover crops and using more precise and efficient irrigation—to produce enough food for everyone while also keeping carbon in the ground. And by rehabilitating soils and reforesting lands that have been degraded or cleared, we can remove even more of that carbon from the atmosphere. Another way to help?

            "January 27th was the most remarkable day in the history of America’s official response to the climate crisis, at least since that June afternoon in 1988, when NASA’s James Hansen told a congressional committee that the planet had begun to heat. On Wednesday, in the course of a few hours, the Biden Administration took a series of coördinated actions that, considered together, may well mark the official beginning of the end of the fossil-fuel era.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Biden Administration temporarily paused the new leasing of federal lands and waters for fossil-fuel production, while speeding up the process of permitting renewables. The President pledged that the federal government would start buying electric cars in volume. His order sets up or strengthens offices in the Justice Department, the Energy Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency to focus on what he called “environmental justice.” He announced that climate change would become a national-security priority for the Pentagon. And all of this came after his earlier pledges to rejoin the Paris climate accord and to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline. There’s a shock-and-awe feel to the barrage of actions, and that is the point: taken together, they send a decisive signal about the end of one epoch and the beginning of another. And that signal, most of all, is aimed at investors: fossil fuel, Biden is making clear, is not a safe bet, or even a good bet, for making real money. Coal, oil, and gas are the past, not the future. They’re the present, too, of course—but you don’t make big-money bets on the present.\n",
            "\n",
            "We may not get to that future fast enough to stave off truly disastrous global warming—the natural world made some announcements of its own this week, including the news that the melt from glaciers and ice sheets is in line with the worst-case scenarios that scientists have produced—and we won’t get to that safer future easily. The fossil-fuel industry is already hitting back hard against the Biden announcements, using the only argument it has left: jobs. But the Administration’s team was prepared for the onslaught—Biden styled his announcements as a job-creation scheme, predicting, for instance, that electric cars would create a million new jobs for autoworkers. And his aides made clear that they understood the need to cushion the blow in areas where oil, gas, and coal jobs are disappearing. “We’re going to make sure that nobody is left behind,” the domestic climate czar Gina McCarthy told reporters. “We need to put people to work in their own communities. That’s where their home is. That’s where the vision is. So we are creatively looking at those opportunities for investment, so that we can get people understanding that we are not trying to take away jobs.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The difference between these actions and the responses of previous Administrations is that Biden isn’t hedging his bets. Probably the day’s most important development was the least remarked upon. The White House made clear that America would stop letting public funds from agencies such as the Export-Import Bank flow to fossil fuels, and that it would use its leverage at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to support the goals of the Paris accord. And then, crucially, John Kerry, who is coördinating the Administration’s global climate policy, made clear in a speech to virtual Davos that this dictum applied to natural gas. “The problem with gas is, if we build out a huge infrastructure for gas now to continue to use it as the bridge fuel—when we haven’t really exhausted the other possibilities—we’re going to be stuck with stranded assets in ten, twenty, thirty years,” he said. “Gas is primarily methane, and we have a huge methane problem, folks.”\n",
            "\n",
            "This statement is enormously important, because gas has always been the Democratic Party’s climate vice. The Obama Administration was willing to take on filthy coal, but did little to rein in fracking for gas—Kerry’s predecessor as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, initiated a program within the State Department to encourage fracking abroad. It was that Administration’s concession to the power of the fossil-fuel industry, which has wagered much of its future on gas; since coal is in terminal decline and oil will see a slow but steady fall as the world electrifies its vehicle fleets, fracked gas was the last chance for real growth for the fossil majors. What Kerry is trying to do is foreclose that gas boom, and it’s likely to work. If you want a straw in the wind, consider the career of Heather Zichal, whose job put her at the center of the Obama Administration’s gas plan, and who, for a period after that Administration left office, served on the board of one of the nation’s largest liquefied-natural-gas exporters. Now she is the head of a new lobby called the American Clean Power Association, and on Wednesday she gave unflinching backing to the Biden plan. “If we’re going to remove 5.1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually and get to zero emissions in 30 years,” she told the Washington Post, “this is going to require drastic action.” Her members, she said, are prepared to invest a trillion dollars in the coming years on clean energy projects. “We see nothing but opportunity.”\n",
            "\n",
            "And the fossil-fuel firms see nothing but trouble. Liam Denning, who edited the “Heard on the Street” column for the Wall Street Journal and wrote the “Lex” column for the Financial Times, explained yesterday for Bloomberg that two of the climate movement’s strategies for cutting off financial support for oil and gas are “delay and doubt.” He said, “The first erodes an investment’s value via the magic of the time value of money. The second does it by raising the cost of capital going in; if something looks riskier, it must clear a higher hurdle before anyone cuts a check to finance it.” Yesterday’s announcements “effectively cast a pall over the longer-term cash flows from oil and gas investments,” he added. “After a decade defined by easy financing and the safe assumption of continued growth, the past week’s politics reaffirm the 2020s present a far murkier prospect for oil and gas. Capital markets will price accordingly—and thereby shape the outcome.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The climate fight is far from over—battles with the fossil-fuel industry will continue for the foreseeable future, and the outcome will determine the pace of the transition toward clean energy. (Keep an eye on the fate of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Line 3 tar-sands pipeline in Minnesota—the new Administration’s climate logic should mean their cancellation, but it would be a heavy political lift.) But this week’s actions mark an unmistakable turning point. The climate movement has, finally, shifted the zeitgeist far enough for an Administration to act decisively, and Joe Biden has risen to the moment.\n",

            "The results, which Exxon called preliminary, were announced by the company after its annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.

            "The alternative directors put forward by the hedge fund were also backed by many of the nation’s most powerful institutional investors.

            "\n",
            "Companies sometimes work with dissident shareholders to accept suggested changes to boards. Exxon, though, had resisted the challenge. It argued that it was already committed to addressing the climate crisis, with plans to add new board members, including one with expertise in climate change. It has also highlighted its plan, still in the early stages, to use the Houston Ship Channel to capture and store carbon dioxide offshore.\n",

            "China’s environmental crisis, the result of decades of rapid industrialization, not only threatens the health and livelihoods of the country’s 1.4 billion people but also the global fight against climate change. As the world’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in recent years, China suffers from notoriously bad air pollution. Its carbon-intensive industries have caused additional environmental challenges, including water scarcity and soil contamination. And, like the rest of the world, China will face increasingly harsh consequences of climate change in the coming decades, including flooding and droughts.\n",
            "\n",
            "In response, Beijing has implemented policies to curb emissions and stem further degradation, such as by signing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate and pledging to be carbon neutral by 2060. However, following through won’t be easy, experts say, as the government struggles to maintain economic growth; ease public discontent; and overcome tensions with the United States, the second-largest emitter.\n",
            "\n",
            "China’s economic rise—national gross domestic product (GDP) grew 10 percent on average each year for more than a decade—has greatly accelerated its emissions. In the past ten years, China has emitted more greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, per year than any other country in the world. It surpassed the United States as the top emitter in 2005, according to Climate Watch. (Emissions per capita in the United States are still more than double those in China.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Coal, which makes up nearly two-thirds of China’s energy consumption, is largely to blame. The country is the world’s largest coal producer and accounts for about half of coal consumed globally. The government banned the construction of new coal-fired power plants in 2016, and coal use appeared to decline. However, when the ban expired in 2018, construction of new plants ramped up again. In 2020, China built over three times more [PDF] new coal-power capacity than the rest of the world combined, according to Global Energy Monitor and the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n",
            "\n",
            "China’s staggering pace of urbanization has also contributed. Urbanization increases energy demands to power new manufacturing and industrial centers, and construction of these centers relies on high energy–consuming products such as cement and steel. Another contributor is the increase in cars on the road: In 2018, people in China owned 240 million vehicles, up from about 27 million in 2004.\n",
            "\n",
            "Internationally, China is the largest financier of fossil fuel infrastructure. Through its massive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has built or is planning to build hundreds of coal-fired power plants in countries around the world. More than 60 percent of BRI-specific energy financing has gone toward nonrenewable resources. Greenhouse gas emissions in more than a dozen BRI countries have soared. Researchers found in 2019 that BRI could drive the global average temperature to increase by 2.7°C, significantly higher than the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C.\n",

            "Like the rest of the world, China will increasingly suffer over the next few decades from the effects of climate change, which include sea-level rise, stronger storms, and more intense heat waves. China’s average temperature and sea levels have risen faster than the global average, according to a 2020 report from China’s National Climate Center.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some of China’s coastal cities, such as Shanghai, could be submerged if the global average temperature continues to rise. An estimated forty-three million people in China live on land that could be underwater by the end of the century if the global average temperature rises by 2°C.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, experts predict that China will experience more frequent extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall. Every year, natural disasters kill hundreds of Chinese people and destroy millions of acres of crops. As temperatures rise, China’s glaciers will continue to melt at an alarming rate, which will likely lead to more devastating floods. Extreme heat events and droughts will also become more common.\n",

            "However, experts say many of these goals aren’t ambitious enough and point out that they don’t align with each other or with the Paris Agreement. For example, China would need to reach peak emissions by 2025 at the latest to be in line with the Paris accord’s goal.\n",
            "\n",
            "Transitioning from coal to renewable energy is critical to China’s efforts, and the country has already made some progress. In 2019, renewables accounted for nearly 15 percent of China’s energy mix, compared to 7 percent a decade earlier. China has used hydropower for years, and it is installing more solar panels and wind power generators as the world’s leading manufacturer of those technologies. It is also boosting its nuclear power capacity, with seventeen reactors under construction as of mid-2021. Moreover, Beijing and some provinces are incentivizing electric vehicle use; in 2019, more electric vehicles—25.8 million—were sold in China than in any other country.

Increased public awareness of China’s notoriously low air quality in the past decade—especially after Beijing suffered a prolonged bout of smog in 2013 that was so severe that citizens dubbed it an “airpocalypse”—has sparked government action. A plan released later in 2013 ordered cities to lower concentrations of tiny hazardous particles known as PM2.5 and directed local governments to implement tougher controls on pollution and coal use. As a result, much of China has seen a significant drop in air pollution. But many regions continue to experience stretches of extreme pollution, and hundreds of mostly northern cities still suffer from high levels of PM2.5.\n",

            "Water insecurity. China is home to about 20 percent of the world’s population but only 7 percent of its freshwater sources. Overuse has led to severe shortages, and industry along China’s major water sources has polluted supplies. Construction of hydropower dams along major rivers has also damaged ecosystems. The government released a plan in 2015 for preventing water pollution that included placing controls on polluting industries. The quality of surface waters—bodies such as lakes, rivers, and streams—has since improved. However, groundwater continues to fall short of targets, with more than 80 percent categorized as “bad to very bad.”\n",

Desertified land is now shrinking on average by nearly one thousand square miles each year, according to government figures.\n",

            "Soil pollution. The government estimated in 2014 that nearly one-fifth of arable land is contaminated. This has consequences for China’s food security: An estimated 12 million tons of the 664 million tons of grain produced annually are polluted by heavy metals. Chemical factories and other industrial sites are mainly to blame, but trash, electronic waste, rare-earth-metal mining, overuse of pesticides, and contaminated water also contribute. In 2019, China’s first comprehensive law to prevent soil pollution took effect, requiring polluters to limit their output or pay for contamination. Two years later, China banned the import of all waste from other countries.\n",

In 2013, the number of “abrupt environmental incidents,” including protests, rose to 712, a 31 percent jump from the previous year.

            "I have often been asked, at the end of a talk on climate change, if the problem couldn’t be solved by shrinking the size of the US military—which, questioners will sometimes assert, is the world’s “number one carbon emitter.” A comprehensive new report from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, “Pentagon Fuel Use, Climate Change, and the Costs of War,” authored by Neta Crawford, a professor of political science at Boston University, helps provide an answer to that question, or rather a series of answers. What they add up to is the idea that the Pentagon can play an outsized part in the climate fight—but only in part by cutting the amount of energy it uses.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Pentagon does indeed use a lot of energy. Maintaining an enormous military machine produces about 59 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, which is more than most of the nations of the world—roughly the equivalent of a Denmark or a Sweden, two Bosnias, or five Cambodias. That’s because you mostly fight war by pouring gas into the tanks of… tanks. And airplanes, and ships, and trucks. As one might guess, fuel efficiency has not always been the highest concern of military planners—the sixty thousand Humvees still in the federal fleet average between four and eight miles to the gallon. For anything larger or more lethal, fuel is measured in gallons per mile. And, of course, the military operates a vast network of bases across the planet, all of which use power.\n",
            "\n",
            "Still—and this is very helpful in understanding the full dimension of our energy dilemma—this is not a particularly large share of the world’s, or even our nation’s, energy consumption. Crawford’s careful analysis shows that the Department of Defense consumes roughly a hundred million barrels of oil a year. The world runs through about a hundred million barrels of oil a day. Even though it’s the world’s largest institutional user of energy, the US military accounts, by Crawford’s figures, for barely 1 percent of America’s greenhouse gas emissions. A useful chart in one of the report’s appendixes shows that the military has, through all the peacetime and wars since 1975, produced fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the US as a whole produces in a single year. This number naturally goes up if you count the emissions from civilian military production, but in relative terms it remains counterintuitively small.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of this is valuable information to anyone trying to grasp the scale of the global warming problem. As giant a consumer as the Pentagon is, its use of energy pales next to that of the civilian population of some three-hundred million Americans—let alone that of a couple of billion humans wealthy enough to consume lots of fossil fuel. Imagine the vast stream of cars that enters and leaves any American city each rush hour and then multiply that by every day of the year. Picture the server farms required to stream every evening’s crop of Netflix shows, or the pulse of natural gas required to heat homes, or the mountains of coal needed to turn on the lights every evening in every home. Energy use is the result of a billion actions every minute of every day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, the military has actually been doing a not-too-shabby job of driving down its emissions—they’ve dropped 50 percent or so since 1991. In part, this is because the huge waste caused by earlier infrastructure has gradually declined across the economy—LED lights, for instance, make everyone more efficient. In part, too, the military has particular reasons to take efficiency seriously. Crawford quotes the then Marine Corps general (and later Trump chew toy) James Mattis from congressional testimony in 2011:\n",
            "\n",
            "On the fuel, it is a significant Achilles heel for us when you have to haul the amounts of fuel that we have to haul around the battlefield for the generators and for the vehicles. We are working with DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency], we are working with a number of civilian organizations to try and find solutions. There are efforts under way to make more expeditionary bases which would actually generate some of their own energy requirements using, for example, solar power. In many of these places, there is a lot of sunshine. If we can get expeditionary capability to capture that and then basically recharge our batteries. I mean, it is an amazingly complex effort to maintain the fuel lines. And it also gives the enemy an ability to choose the time and place of attacking us.\n",
            "\n",
            "In other words, solar panels would shorten supply lines, a goal of every army in history. Crawford is right, I think, to insist that reducing the carbon footprint of the US military would reduce the global warming threat, but also right not to claim that it would have any kind of decisive effect. Denmark, after all, could go dark tomorrow without materially altering the climate change outcome for the planet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the military’s focus on energy use is uniquely important for other reasons, some of which Crawford explores. One is that, since Congress and presidents afford it incredible spending largesse (by some measures the US spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined), it has the freedom to explore new technologies that end up transferring to civilian use. Radar produced microwave ovens; the need for easy communications gave us, at some remove, the Internet. And so on. This ability could be harnessed more directly to help us build the new technologies and connect them in the systems necessary for a renewable energy age. The military-industrial complex may not be the single best place to conduct R&D, but given current political realities, it is likely to be one of the few places where it’s actually possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond that, the military spends much of its time engaged in the exercise that the rest of American public and private life seems to strenuously avoid: thinking hard about the future, with an emphasis on what could go wrong. This realism about risk and threats already led, over several decades, to regular Pentagon reports that defied Washington’s official nonchalance about climate change. As the climate expert Peter Gleick noted in a recent study:\n",
            "\n",
            "It is vital to understand the history of U.S. intelligence and military assessments of the security implications of climate change. These assessments go back nearly four decades to the 1980s and since that time, hundreds of assessments of climate change, a massively growing body of literature on the impacts of human-caused climate change, and analyses from every U.S. defense, intelligence, and security agency have acknowledged the links between climate and security.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the first of these reports three decades ago, the military has tended to be direct in delivering bad news. As Naval War College experts told the Senate in 1990, “naval operations in the coming half century may be drastically affected by the impact of global climate change. For the Navy to be fully prepared for operations in this future climate environment, resources of both mind and money must be committed to the problem.” That commitment most recently produced a DoD report to Congress released in January that began, “the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) missions, operational plans, and installations.” Considering the general tenor of the Trump administration toward climate reality, this is a strong statement, but many noted that the DoD seemed to be pulling at least some punches in deference to the current administration. A congressional request for a list of bases likely to be affected by climate change went largely unanswered, for instance, and Democratic congressman and House Armed Services Committee chairman Adam Smith said: “The Department of Defense presented no specifics on what is required to ensure operational viability and mission resiliency, and failed to estimate the future costs associated with ensuring these installations remain viable.”\n",
            "\n",
            "If this reticence continues it will be a sadly missed opportunity, because the Pentagon, when it speaks frankly, has the potential to reach Americans who won’t listen to scientists. In 2013, for example, Admiral Samuel Locklear, the commander of Pacific forces, told reporters that climate change “is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen… that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.… People are surprised sometimes,” he added. “You have the real potential here in the not-too-distant future of nations displaced by rising sea level.” Indeed. For if the UN estimate of two hundred million to a billion climate refugees by the end of this century is anything close to correct, that poses the greatest threat imaginable to peace on the planet. Only consider how thoroughly a million migrants from the Syrian crisis discombobulated Western politics in this decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "The most hopeful thought, of course, is that a move by the Pentagon—and the broader society it might influence—to more sustainable energy supplies could not only reduce the risk of all-out climate chaos, but it could also remove the most persistent justification for an outsized US military: the protection of oil supplies in the Middle East. At a moment when the White House is on a hair-trigger over suspicions that Iran has been attacking oil tankers, the prospect of how much tensions would be reduced on a planet that ran on widely available sun and wind is more attractive than ever. Crawford writes, “as a consequence of spending less money on fuel and operations to provide secure access to petroleum, the US could, in the long run, decrease US military spending and reorient its economy to more economically productive activities.” It could also free us to spend fewer anxious nights worrying about the next war and the next heatwave.\n",

By the time I sat down to rewrite the essay last fall, California was on fire again, with three of the four largest wildfires in state history raging simultaneously. The sky above San Francisco turned an unearthly, apocalyptic orange. Sunlight could no longer penetrate the ash, photovoltaic panels stopped working, and the air-quality index in many places exceeded the most polluted cities in Asia, where millions of children have irreversible lung damage. People living in California, Oregon, and Washington State found themselves trapped in their homes. Houses, subdivisions, and entire towns lay in charred ruins. Those who could do so moved their families to safer areas, much as people had done in the early days of the pandemic. As far away as the East Coast, smoke from the fires marred the air, and from where I watched, north of New York City, the evening sun vanished in the haze before it touched the horizon.\n",

            "Like a spinning wheel that becomes a uniform blur, the relentless pace of unfolding catastrophe is turning into a fixed calendar of disaster that in many places will soon become as regular as the seasons. “Day turns to night as smoke extinguishes all light in the horrifying minutes before the red glow announces the imminence of the inferno,” wrote the Australian novelist Richard Flanagan during the 2019–20 bushfire season. In California, too, the images and stories seemed to belong less to peacetime than to war, and indeed this metaphor has become commonplace in our rhetoric about the climate threat. Al Gore, writing in the New York Times, put it starkly:\n",

            "Similar martial rhetoric weaves through many of today’s decarbonization narratives, from David Wallace-Wells’s The Uninhabitable Earth to Saul Griffith’s Rewiring America, and it gives John Kerry’s climate-crisis coalition, World War Zero, its name.\n",
            "\n",
            "But for all the rhetoric of war, the shape of the metaphor remains fuzzy. If it is simply meant to justify a certain scale of government response—a warlike reallocation of industry, logistical capacity, and spending—it mistakes the true implication of the metaphor and the source of its power. For as the coronavirus has taught us, the credibility of a threat and our sense of responsibility to protect ourselves and others against it can change our behavior in ways we might have thought impossible. What distinguishes a “just” war—that is, a necessary and nonelective war, fought for survival or defense—is that it involves everyone; it is fought by the country, not only the government and not only those who bear arms in combat. It is a source of meaning in addition to anguish.\n",

            "To those who still harbor doubts about the justness of this war, who continue to question the scientific consensus on global warming and the ravages it promises, I ask only that you entertain, if there is a chance you are right, that there is also a chance you are wrong. Let us even say, for argument’s sake, that the virtual certainty of scientists were reduced to 50 percent confidence and the forecasted effects of climate violence were reduced in severity by 50 percent as well. That would still justify the most massive mobilization of human energy and resources the world has ever seen, because the likely outcome would still be far worse than any threat we have faced in the past.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, there are some who accept the seriousness of the threat but console themselves with the possibility that we might overcome it without serious disruption to our lives. The cost of solar power has fallen by more than 80 percent in the past decade and shows no sign of stopping. Wind power has followed suit. According to reports by the International Renewable Energy Agency and others, wind and solar are now the cheapest forms of energy in most cases, and there are already many places where building new wind and solar capacity is cheaper than continuing to run existing coal plants. Synergistic technologies, such as batteries and electric cars, have improved dramatically over the same period, and there has been progress on more intractable problems such as the decarbonization of air travel and the production of cement, glass, and steel.\n",

            "But for all the good news, we would be foolish to think technology alone will save us. The fossil-fuel industry will not disappear quietly. Subsidies will not unwind themselves. Legislation to transform our energy system will not enact itself. Politicians must be moved from complicity and intransigence. Minds must be changed. And most crucially, even if we manage in the coming decades to remake our global energy system, we will still need a new form of civic solidarity to deal with the ecological trials headed our way.\n",

When it comes to arresting fast-moving pandemics, supplying drinking water to eight billion people, or managing refugee flows in the tens of millions, the sheer scale of these problems leaves little hope for after-the-fact technological fixes.

What if the challenge confronting us isn’t our greatest threat but our greatest opportunity, not a moment of self-denial and self-destruction, but of self-creation and self-discovery? What if, to be more precise, our greatest threat is also our greatest opportunity, because overcoming monumental challenges, when wisdom and heroism are possible, is the great gift of human life, the substance of our proudest moments, and the matter from which ur-meaning is built?\n",

Democratic institutions strain and buckle. Norms tremble in the fierce crosswinds of power. We cannot find a way to do even simple things most people agree on: bring down the cost of medications, regulate guns to prevent mass shootings, raise taxes on the rich, or overhaul out-of-date infrastructure. How can we be so far apart when we want so many of the same things? What has gotten so fouled up that vague symbolic fights obscure the irreducible communal basis of our prosperity and strength?\n",

            "Let me tell a different story about what has gone wrong. Our fundamental affliction is not the magnitude of our problems but our alienation from their manifest solutions. Our tools have never made us more powerful, yet we seem more powerless than ever to effect change. Our primary way of interacting with the world is through a screen, and our principal avenue to changing anything appears to be typing into or clicking on that screen. We are alienated from the earth, from our hands, and from one another. We appear to be part of an efficient system that has brought ever more and cheaper goods to market, but our skills have become specialized to the point of practical uselessness. Our ability to create and cultivate the goods that we rely on and enjoy has shriveled to almost nothing. There is a maddening abstraction to our reality, a virtuality to all life. We are told that we are hopelessly partisan and polarized—patriotic or traitorous, awake to truth or in thrall to lies—but above all we are separate: from one another despite our mutual dependency and from the material reality on which every aspect of our life depends. We are separate from the actions we might undertake, and undertake together, to solve the tangible problems before us, which do not care what brand name or party affiliation their solutions go by. We believe hate is endemic, that we are at one another’s throats, but we don’t know one another. We have never gotten close enough to shake hands, much less see that the throat we mean to grab has wrinkles like our own. We carry the burden of crushing loneliness, and find ourselves isolated from friend and imaginary foe alike. We are trapped in the virtual amber of our paralytic culture, where helplessness and impotence sit on the vine so long they ripen and rot into enmity, vitriol, and rage.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is a strange irony that climate change has, until recently, had a virtual quality of its own. This is the very essence of what has made it so difficult to combat. The same reason policy disagreements endure for years—that consequences don’t follow actions closely enough to establish irrefutable empirical links—is the same reason our society can recognize the danger posed by a warming planet and do nothing about it for decades. Though nearly every technology in our lives relies on truths (such as electrical or chemical properties) that we apprehend only indirectly, it is in our nature to have a complicated and problematic relationship with the reality—the truth—of our abstract knowledge.\n",

            "But now climate violence is emerging from the shadows. It is setting fire to forests we can see, scattering the air we breathe with ash, and filling city streets with water. It has begun marching on our offscreen terrain. The past few decades have been what the French call the drôle de guerre, the period after war is declared and before real fighting begins. Except, because what we confront with the climate crisis is war waged on a several-decade delay, the battle started long before the first shots were heard. The challenge of organizing ourselves around this crisis before its worst consequences reach us is no different from the challenge of reclaiming truth from the burning timbers of our smoldering virtual culture—of reknitting a fabric of shared purpose from shared interest. Climate change is the crisis of virtual insouciance stepping terrifyingly into the real.\n",

Where reality gives way to fantasy, politics breaks down; and where politics breaks down, war, revolution, and violence rise up—so Carl von Clausewitz and John F. Kennedy each suggested. If we fail to see the truth of what lies after politics—not the absence of policy, but the presence, the certainty, of violence—we do not bring sufficient determination to the fight to redeem politics. The climate crisis lays this truth bare.\n",

            "Sebastian Junger reiterates this point in his book War, in which he chides our culture for lacking the courage to see “that one of the most traumatic things about combat is having to give it up.” Civilian life feels empty by comparison, he writes:\n",
            "\n",
            "When men say they miss combat, it’s not that they actually miss getting shot at—you’d have to be deranged—it’s that they miss being in a world where everything is important and nothing is taken for granted. They miss being in a world where human relations are entirely governed by whether you can trust the other person with your life.\n",

            "Junger wrote War after embedding with soldiers in Afghanistan’s Korengal Valley, one of the war’s deadliest fronts. He talks to soldiers on leave who were desperate to return to the fight. “I got to get back there,” one says. “Those are my boys.” The Army Research Branch has documented cases of wounded soldiers going AWOL to rejoin their units faster, Junger tells us. What keeps drawing “sane, good men” back to combat is not the killing, but “the other side of the equation: protecting. The defense of the tribe is an insanely compelling idea, and once you’ve been exposed to it, there’s almost nothing you’d rather do.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The flip side of this—removing people from meaningful involvement in the ongoing, communal struggle to live—may be as disaffecting as engagement is compelling. Combat brings latent desires to the surface, desires for purpose, intensity, solidarity, and belonging. These are the very needs that draw young people to tribes of violence and hate, whether neo-Nazi groups or the Islamic State. Gun culture, gang culture, and certain forms of religious fundamentalism traffic in the common intuition that violence is a person’s chief outlet for meaningful action. The persistence of mass shootings and religious massacres confirms that some people do locate agency in this dark place. Many others who do not turn to violence surely suffer the same feeling of disconnection, the sense of having no part in forging the bridges that link the past to the future.\n",

But I would go further still and say that when we lose sight of any connection between what we do and what sustains us, an unreality enters our sense of the world. Our conviction that other people are real—that their lives and fates matter irrespective of our own—withers such that we hardly see it go. When we don’t feel that we uphold life, we can’t figure out how to value it. We become, at last, partly unreal to ourselves.\n",

            "In the foreword to an updated edition of his World War II memoir The Warriors, writing now in the midst of the Vietnam War, the philosopher J. Glenn Gray returned to his earlier intuition that something had gone dreadfully wrong in the contemporary world. His initial feeling had arisen, he believed, from a new kind of total war, one “in which terroristic bombing of cities and civilians became for the first time the rule.” But the significance of this development eluded him until he heard a Japanese philosopher give a talk on the “monstrous character” of modern civilization. The speaker described Japan as having become “the most godless nation of all, with no real motivations other than impulses for material goods and sex.” His lecture focused on the question of whether “men of the East or West can survive without any god or gods.” His explicit answer, Gray tells us, “was an unyielding No.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Neither the speaker nor Gray, as he wrestled with what our monstrous age had to do with the “attempt to live godlessly,” meant God in the usual religious sense. For Gray, God is the intimation, in the simple words of a soldier in Vietnam who chose to report his unit’s war crimes, that we have “to answer to something, to someone—maybe just to ourselves.” Godlessness is having no one, nothing, to answer to. It is the fundamental abstraction of ourselves from the impact and meaning of our actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Far more than the infantry soldier who “occasionally goes berserk,” Gray writes, this abstraction afflicts “the man who kills from a distance and without consciousness of the consequences of his deeds.” The dissociation follows such a man back into civilian life, where an “unconscious depravity” can grow unseen. Gray calls these the “terrifyingly normal” men who “are ever in the vast majority” and “make our age a monstrous one.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, we see such godless abstraction everywhere: in military adventures championed by those who dodged service themselves; in efforts to coax people into debts they have no hope of repaying; in the cynical sale and false marketing of addictive opioids; in the countless disembodied acts companies ask their employees to undertake whose downstream consequences portend the suffering of others. The British writer Dan Gretton uses the term “desk killer” (from the German Schreibtischtäter) to describe this new abstracted manner of presiding over death, and this same dissociation clearly lies at the heart of how we let the climate crisis fester for decades, when inaction ultimately hurts everyone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Godless abstraction permits situations where what seem to be rational individual decisions ultimately add up to collective madness. There are many examples, but the image from Junger’s book of American soldiers firing Javelin rockets at anticoalition forces in Afghanistan captures it as well as anything. One Javelin round costs $80,000, and Junger marvels at “the idea that it’s fired by a guy who doesn’t make that in a year at a guy who doesn’t make that in a lifetime.” Rocket after rocket goes off, eighty grand a pop. Meanwhile, the fighters on both sides have mostly taken to the battlefield for lack of economic opportunities elsewhere.\n",

            "Does this make any sense? Can you work backward from this apparent insanity to explain how this is a proper use of money or life? It is fundamentally no different from the logic that describes how and why we have filled the air with as much greenhouse gases in the thirty years since we have known the threat they posed as in all the years of human history before then. We have outsourced and deferred mortal costs, when, had we borne them directly, we would have known they were too great. The cost is economic, but at a certain point of vital significance, economic and spiritual costs are no different.\n",

            "It implies forgetfulness of the encompassing world to which we are so totally bound, both as individuals and as a species. No longer do we feel answerable to this encompassing which is within us, as memory, imagination, and consciousness, or without us as soil and sun and air and water. We are forgetful of the fact that these latter are not simply things of our environment but natural powers and fibres of which we are made and which enable us to be sustained in existence every moment.\n",

            "A thesis that informs my argument is the belief that the certainty of death, and our efforts to resist and postpone it, are what permit meaning in life. It follows from this thesis that obscuring our relation to this certainty obscures the true stakes and significance of living. The parents who believe that it should not be their child who fights in a war, or their child who forgoes some special advantage, or their child who opts out of today’s careerism at the call of conscience, is no different from the politician or pundit who tells us we cannot “afford” to act on climate change. Generalized and applied to society at large, these self-exempting principles make us weaker, poorer, and more likely to die. For fear of death, they teach us, we cannot afford to protect life.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the same way, by paying rhetorical homage only to the suffering that climate violence is sure to bring, and neglecting, as perhaps in bad taste, the potential promise in a fight we can’t avoid, we perpetuate a form of the dishonesty that got us here. This is the belief that how we talk about something—whether guided by ideological or moralistic convictions—affects its underlying reality: that by insistence we can freight the unconscious world with our moral schemas. But nature is dispassionate, and we are not being punished. No amount of atonement or misgiving makes any difference. We have a practical crisis on our hands, and it is the first truly universal project in which all of us—all living things—are on the same side.\n",
            "\n",
            "One promise in this fight—if we address it with the pragmatic clarity one needs in a war—is that it will force us to learn exactly how we relate to the world beyond us and how irrelevant the ego’s preferred myths are to achieving anything tangible. At its best, war has been a tonic that disabuses such idle myths: simplistic equations, for example, about how competitiveness, self-reliance, and self-gratification redound to prosperity, strength, and happiness. Nowhere does war root out more misguided thinking than in the realm of economics, since of all the things whose costs we are told we can’t afford, the expensive diversion of human and industrial capacity to the project of explicit destruction would seem to be first in its class. But going to war rests on the argument that forgoing its expense would be more costly still.\n",
            "\n",
            "In this way, war helps put the economics of fighting climate change in perspective. It reminds us that words such as “cost” and “afford,” when applied to society as a whole, do not describe objective conditions but rather implicit arguments about how we should expend our energy and resources: which activities and investments today are going to be worth it in the long run.\n",

            "The preservation of life would seem to be a no-brainer, yet even in the years leading up to America’s entrance into World War II, when the threat posed by a fully mobilized Germany and Japan was clear, the Roosevelt Administration had trouble securing the modest appropriations it sought. Members of Congress, pundits, and other political figures inveighed against the cost and practical impossibility of the war mobilization. When Roosevelt announced that he would like to see the nation producing fifty thousand warplanes a year, Charles Lindbergh dismissed the figure as “hysterical chatter.” To many, he had a point. According to Arthur Herman’s book Freedom’s Forge, aircraft manufacturers in 1938 were supplying the U.S. military with only about ninety planes a month.\n",
            "\n",
            "Across virtually every industry, as Herman’s book details, the intended expansion of military capacity and the time frame expected to achieve it appeared impossible, and yet, despite all manner of opposition, naysaying, and bureaucratic headwind, the targets were routinely met and exceeded. The production of tanks, in one instance, went from thirteen to more than a thousand per month. Mammoth shipbuilding endeavors sprang up in mudflats and marshes, and new industries, such as synthetic rubber, went from producing virtually nothing to hundreds of thousands of tons of material. The vast majority of these initiatives ratcheted up to full capacity in only eighteen months.\n",
            "\n",
            "Herman tells the story of how the private and public sectors worked together through the war years to create an “arsenal of democracy.” In three years, beginning effectively from a standing start, the industrial capacity of the nation would overtake that of the Axis powers and go on to produce two thirds of all the military equipment used by the Allies. The war created more than half a million new American businesses, Herman writes, while simultaneously jolting thousands of existing businesses out of the doldrums of the Depression.\n",

            "The ultimate outlay required of the United States would top $300 billion. Consider that in 1939, U.S. defense spending eclipsed $1 billion for the first time since 1918. The difficulty in funding the mobilization reflected the belief among politicians that such expenditures could not be afforded, or else, after a decade-long depression, could be put to better use. But this wartime spending—deficit spending that as a percentage of GDP exceeded anything before or since—underwrote a booming economy that grew, for certain years of the war, in excess of 17 percent and nearly doubled from the start of the war to its end. Not only did the United States emerge from the war anything but crippled with debt—the growth and shared prosperity the country experienced in the subsequent decades would prove unparalleled.\n",

            "No one, looking back, would say that the need to confront Germany and Japan did not justify the immense redeployment of resources.

It is hard to see how a revolution in technologies that promise limitless clean energy could fail to underwrite the next chapter of human prosperity.

One study concluded that the costs associated with 3.7 degrees of warming—extreme heat, drought, water stress, flooding, reductions in crop yield, increased exposure to malaria and dengue fever, and sea-level rise—would be $551 trillion worldwide. That is substantially more than the global wealth that currently exists. The 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California, affected a large but fairly sparsely populated area (0.006 percent of total U.S. land) and still managed to cause more than $16 billion in damage, twice the annual budget of the EPA.\n",

Manufacturing volume in the country nearly tripled over this period. The production of raw materials went up by 60 percent.

Sacrifice suggests forgoing what you are entitled to or would otherwise want, but not all forms of giving constitute sacrifice.

Kennedy’s famous exhortation—“Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country”—is stirring and profound because it recognizes that being asked to give affirms dignity and worth, whereas being encouraged to take, consume, or hoard sells you a vision of your own worthlessness wrapped in a flimsy tissue of momentary, misguided hope. This hope is for connection to others and a way out of loneliness, emptiness, or boredom. Consumption betrays our hope not only because inanimate objects can’t fulfill this longing for connection, but also because transaction teaches us that we have nothing to give but money and are therefore meaningless and interchangeable as individuals. It establishes only the weakest form of human relationship, making our connection to others seem remote and insecure, and ultimately deepening the loneliness it was meant to relieve.\n",

            "We are currently suffering an epidemic of loneliness in the United States, where studies have found that social isolation is more lethal than obesity or smoking fifteen cigarettes a day. The number of suicides in the country has gone up nearly 50 percent since 2006, and rates of suicide and depression among young people aged ten to twenty-four jumped roughly 60 percent between 2007 and 2017. Life expectancy has fallen in recent years, as the opioid crisis has claimed hundreds of thousands of victims and Americans have succumbed to so-called deaths of despair. We are at the same time facing a form of polarization that regiments different identity facets into what the political scientist Lilliana Mason calls “mega-identities.” There are fewer points of contact and shared beliefs among broad swaths of the population.\n",

            "The types of disconnection behind these trends—interpersonal isolation, national division, the febrile aloneness of screen life and social media, work abstracted from tangible purpose—will end in crisis if a more pressing one does not first drive us back into one another’s arms. It is a type of decadence to indulge so much division when collaboration and solidarity are the basis of our power and plenty. It is likewise a mark of temporary privilege that we have let fantasy contaminate our shared truth. If we cannot rid ourselves of this decadence and privilege, the inexorable reality of climate violence will do so for us.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why not then address this problem head-on? Why not seize the opportunity to stimulate our economy, rebuild our nation, take meaningful action, and come together in common purpose? At a time of declining productivity, crumbling infrastructure, widening social division, and insecure and often meaningless jobs, to turn away from this bright future and instead toward pessimism and apathy is a sign of cultural depression. We are caught in a vicious cycle, where our social illness robs us of the energy and will to do what is necessary to recover.\n",
            "\n",
            "Can a fight to rebuild and protect our land from a violent climate shake us out of this despair? War has lost its luster, but in seeking to suffocate the martial enthusiasm that swept countries into battle in the past, we appear to have abandoned the language of national adventure and mythic heroism that vast communal projects require. For all its ills, war has at times galvanized social bodies that were liable to dissipate and fray on their own. What we must do now is find a constructive shared endeavor that unites us without promoting what is heinous about war.\n",
            "\n",
            "If such a thing exists, the climate fight—the first comprehensive global challenge—would seem to be it. History has then put before us the adversity in which the steel of the soul is forged. It has given us an opportunity to tell our children and grandchildren that instead of bickering and nursing narcissistic grudges, instead of basking idly in our ephemeral plenty, we acted with grit and resolve.\n",

            "In mobilizing, we may find that what seems a burden turns out to be a blessing. Common struggle holds great riches and satisfaction. Giving—having something to give—is more meaningful than hiding out in fortresses of grievance. We have lived too long in an online dreamworld, and it has made us overly enamored of our feelings and beliefs. What we give will be measured in humility and restraint, in valuing people for what they do rather than for what they merely think.\n",

It promises to free us from our certainty and from the wounded righteousness consuming us. It promises to let us see one another and be seen. It offers us the chance to work together, build something, and take the first timid steps back toward trust.\n",
            "\n",
            "If we fail to mobilize now, we may never have another chance. The notion of a single ungodly disaster that finally spurs us to action and compels the government to respond is a fantasy. If it comes, it will be too late. We will not be individually prepared, and we will expect the government to take charge. We will find ourselves helpless and subject to larger forces, natural and human, on all sides. We will, in short, let the crisis go to waste.\n",

            "Instead, we must act now, renewing civic vigor and restoring the social institutions that enfranchise us and build community. More concretely, we should establish a national jobs program focused on the climate fight, pulling back from a volunteer (and increasingly privatized) military, and deepen our global outreach. The nation building we have asked the military to perform belongs more properly to noncombat missions such as the Peace Corps. As the conservationist Joe Walston has noted, significant battles in the climate fight will play out in places like sub-Saharan Africa, and the results will depend in part on whether countries in the region urbanize effectively and succeed in educating girls.\n",

            "Other endeavors should include everything from computer modeling to ocean farming. Overhauling the world’s industrial and energy systems will demand a massive amount of labor. The climate fight will draw on the tangible skills of builders, ecologists, technologists, electrical engineers, agriculturalists, nurses, emergency medical personnel, firefighters, pilots, conservationists, urban planners, and countless others. Whether it is learning to grow our food, fortify our houses, treat injuries, or build communities of mutual support, we may find that the challenges of a world remade by climate change are sources of profound meaning and fulfillment.\n",
            "\n",
            "But how we move from admiring the problem to organizing around it is not a trivial issue; it is the central challenge in this battle. We need the leadership of those who have experience building and directing coalitions, from union organizers and military veterans to activists and campaign managers. The research of the political scientist Erica Chenoweth shows that nonviolent protests involving just 3.5 percent of a population have reliably brought down recalcitrant regimes. It doesn’t take much for popular will to overwhelm the apparent, but secretly precarious, authority of political, military, and business elites. To this end, we must consider civil disobedience and strikes. Students should walk out of class, and we must pressure companies from within (as employees) and without (as consumers) to act as responsible stewards of the future. There are endless points of leverage because everything and everyone is relevant.\n",

            "The tide could turn more quickly than people think. In World War II, it took only eighteen months to retool American industry into an unprecedented arsenal. The U.S. military today, unlike so much of the government that funds it, recognizes climate change for the existential threat it is, and the tight margins that make corporations so resistant to change also make them profoundly susceptible to pressure. But we have scarcely begun to mobilize. We are simply not acting as though we are at war.\n",

The longer we drag our feet, the less we stand to gain and the more we impoverish our future selves. The climate crisis is a test we are not guaranteed to pass. Can we change? Can we speak, relate, and think differently? Can we put aside our differences and resist the seductions of cynicism and moralism? Ironically, the instinct behind the tribalism that is tearing our political culture apart is the drive to band together to protect the group. What has been a political liability could become an asset in a fight that requires solidarity—if only we can channel it toward common threats and away from exaggerated symbolic divisions.\n",

            "A frequent dream of those who have experienced war is to somehow reap its positive benefits without enduring the crucible of so terrible, destructive, and dehumanizing an experience. Since we cannot avoid the climate fight, we should take advantage of the opportunity it presents to restitch the fabric of communal life and fate. Gray, the philosopher, describes the enlarging capacity of war as arising not from power or victory, but from the awareness of being part of something greater than yourself, subject to larger forces, and connected to people and things beyond you:\n",

            "The most profound costs of addressing climate change will not be financial or physical, but personal and social. If we can summon the courage to act, we will discover that these costs are also our most profound rewards. They mark an end to our isolation, alienation, and division. But they ask something of us, something that is difficult because it takes place in private, unrewarded instants: an inner giving, denominated in openness and restraint. We must learn not to covet our power, but mistrust it. Not to lord victory over others, but to show solicitude and modesty in triumph. We must see fortune and success as a responsibility, not a boundless permission to do whatever we please. We must hold fast to conscience while repulsing moralism. We must extend tolerance beyond the narrow confines of advocacy and favor, and see humor—good humor—as the handmaiden of humility.\n",

Listen for the storm approaching. Listen for what people do not say or do not know how to say, but which recalls your own longing, fear, graciousness, and hope. You do not have to believe anything to join this fight—just know that underneath the protective layers of personality every person is authentic. Every human being is real.

            "That's why scientists have to speak out, according to Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard history of science professor who has taken a close look at the causes and effects of climate change denial.\n",
            "\n",
            "Oreskes, co-author, with Erik Conway, of the 2010 book \"Merchants of Doubt,\" said that many climate scientists today are loath to speak out on the issue, instead saying that their role ends with gathering and presenting the facts. They worry that being viewed as an advocate or activist will damage scientific credibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a talk Wednesday at the Science Center, Oreskes offered historical examples, from Albert Einstein's advocacy for nuclear arms control to Sherwood Rowland's clamoring for action to stop the ozone hole, of scientists who called attention to a threat poorly understood by the public without sacrificing their scientific integrity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Climate science, Oreskes said, needs more knowledgeable people explaining potential effects, so that citizens better understand that it's a crisis affecting them and their communities, not just distant glaciers and polar bears. Despite having given hundreds of talks on the issue, Oreskes is not confident that enough people understand just how serious uncontrolled climate change would be.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are times, Oreskes said, that a scientist must serve as a \"sentinel\" — someone who knows about a threat before the public and policymakers, and acts to alert society to that danger. In recent history there have been many examples, she pointed out, ranging from ozone and nuclear weapons to secondhand smoke and acid rain.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the case of nuclear weapons, despite broad appreciation that nuclear bombs were hugely destructive, most of the world — even President Harry Truman, who said the U.S. would win any nuclear arms race — didn't understand that the scale of destruction potentially threatened the planet, she noted.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, in the 1970s, when Rowland realized that chlorofluorocarbons used in spray cans and refrigeration were harming the ozone that protected the planet from cancer-causing radiation, he spoke out and worked toward a ban, enacted in an international treaty, the Montreal Protocol of 1987.\n",
            "\n",
            "Setting limits around expertise is important, Oreskes said. In climate, she said, that means explaining the science behind the issue, talking about the potential impacts, and noting the need for action. She warned against stepping beyond expertise to a field where one has little experience — for an atmospheric scientist, for example, to push a carbon tax over emissions trading as a way to curb CO2 emissions, a choice better left to policy experts.\n",
            "\n",
            "In her talk, sponsored by the Physics Department and hosted by Professor Melissa Franklin, Oreskes noted where the history of climate study offers examples of scientists serving as sentinels, including Roger Revelle, who wrote a 1965 report calling attention to carbon dioxide emissions' potential to cause a greenhouse effect that would warm the planet. The report, Oreskes said, was well-received by government officials at the time and proved prescient, predicting that if nothing was done, atmospheric carbon dioxide could rise 25 percent by 2000, a level at which climate effects would be visible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Part of the reason facts can't be left to speak for themselves, Oreskes said, is that facts have enemies. There have been repeated backlashes when scientific insights demand government action, and those backlashes often include attempts to discredit the facts, she said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Denial, she said, isn't about science but about individualism, skepticism of government power, the self-interest of those in affected industries, and conceptions of freedom. For those moved by those concerns, climate change is just the latest in a series of scientific problems leading to greater government intrusion. Disputing climate facts has roots in fear, Oreskes said — not of climate, but of higher taxes, bigger government, and lost freedoms.\n",
            "\n",
            "That's why fighting on the facts is not enough, she said. Deploying a value-based argument — such as the values of fairness, of responsibility, of protecting health — is crucial.\n",

Last month, a judge in the state of Oregon allowed a lawsuit filed by Our Children’s Trust on behalf of 21 minors to proceed. The suit argues that despite compelling evidence over many decades that climate change is a major problem the Federal Government has not done enough, infringing on the rights of the younger generation. It states:\n",

            "Defendants’ acts also discriminate against these young citizens, who will disproportionately experience the destabilized climate system in our country.\n",

            "The suit, which calls on the Federal Government to stop permitting and subsidizing projects with large climate impacts, is not surprising—the same organization tried something similar in 2012 that was tossed out. What is interesting this time around is that the suit was accepted by magistrate judge Thomas Coffin of the U.S. District Court in Oregon, and will now head to Federal District Court.\n",

            "Putting kids on the stand is not the only legal innovation taking place in climate activism. According to Steven Novella at Neurologica, some attorneys general are mulling the idea of suing climate change deniers.

            "\n",

            "“This could open up years of litigation and settlements in the same way that tobacco litigation did, also spearheaded by attorneys general,” Brandon L. Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law tells Gillis and Krauss. “In some ways, the theory is similar—that the public was misled about something dangerous to health. Whether the same smoking guns will emerge, we don’t know yet.”\n",

            "NASA is best known for exploring other worlds, whether that’s sending astronauts to the Moon or flying helicopters on Mars. But under US President Joe Biden, the space agency intends to boost its reputation as a major player in studying Earth — especially with an eye towards fighting climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Biden made clear that climate is a priority,” says Waleed Abdalati, director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences in Boulder, Colorado. “There’s a clear role for NASA to play in that,” he says, given all the Earth-science research it funds and the Earth-observing satellites it launches.\n",
            "\n",
            "In recent months, NASA has signalled its intention to reinvigorate its role in informing US climate policy, by appointing its first climate adviser and ramping up work on key missions to study how Earth’s climate is changing.\n",
            "\n",
            "The work is particularly crucial as climate change accelerates, agency officials say. “The demand for actionable information is going to increase pretty dramatically over the next decade or two,” says Karen St. Germain, head of NASA’s Earth-science division in Washington DC.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among the many US federal agencies that Biden has conscripted to curb climate change, NASA stands out because it is a leader in basic planetary discoveries. Its history of Earth observation stretches back to 1960, when it launched the TIROS-1 satellite to test the feasibility of monitoring weather from space. Over more than six decades, NASA has designed, built and launched spacecraft to observe Earth as it changes. Often working in concert with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which has primary responsibility for national weather forecasting, NASA runs satellites that measure ice sheets melting and carbon dioxide flowing through the atmosphere. The agency also flies aeroplanes to gather data about planetary change and funds a broad array of fundamental climate research, such as climate-modelling studies. “Our central role is in understanding how the Earth system is changing,” says St. Germain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, whose policies favoured industry and downplayed climate change, repeatedly tried to cancel major NASA Earth-science missions, only to see them rescued by Congress. It was part of a broader pattern across the Trump administration of undercutting climate-change research and policy. NASA escaped the worst of those attacks by keeping most of its climate-change and Earth-science research below the radar of Trump officials. But it was a politically fraught time for the agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, NASA is literally reclaiming its seat at the table. Biden initially left the agency off the high-level climate task force he established a week after taking office in January. Following some pointed phone calls, NASA muscled its way into that group, and is now represented alongside administration heavyweights such as the secretaries of the treasury and defence as they discuss the nation’s climate strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "“If you’re going to make policy related to scientific questions, you need to have science at the table,” says Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City and the agency’s new climate adviser.\n",
            "\n",
            "NASA’s new administrator, former senator Bill Nelson, has said that he supports the agency’s Earth-science research. “You can’t mitigate climate change unless you measure it, and that’s NASA’s expertise,” he said at his Senate confirmation hearing on 21 April.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among NASA’s epic observations of climate change are a 29-year programme recording global sea-level rise, measured precisely from space with French collaborators and others, and studies that began in 2002 to track ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica, done with German partners. Upcoming missions include a US-Indian radar satellite that will track planetary changes such as shifts in sea-ice cover, and a US-Canadian-French-UK spacecraft that will survey freshwater resources and ocean currents. Both are slated to launch next year.\n",
            "\n",
            "But NASA has struggled to get some of its most anticipated climate missions under way. It intends to launch a series of spacecraft that would measure fundamental aspects of global warming, such as shifts in clouds and precipitation, and changes in Earth’s mass as groundwater dries up. These missions were shaped by an influential 2018 report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which named five ‘designated observables’ that NASA should track. Collectively, NASA calls them an Earth system observatory; they would help scientists to continue to track global change, and give policymakers data they need to inform actions on climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "The report estimated that the necessary missions might cost between US$300 million and $800 million apiece, and suggested that they might be doable even with tight budgets. NASA’s annual Earth-science budget has hovered around $2 billion for years, even as other agency programmes, such as planetary sciences, received huge funding increases.\n",
            "\n",
            "In April, Biden proposed boosting NASA’s Earth-sciences budget to nearly $2.3 billion, although Congress would need to approve it. “It’s a big help and I’m supportive of it,” says Abdalati, who previously served as NASA’s chief scientist and also co-led the 2018 National Academies report. But “as a result of underinvestment for so many years, it looks better than it is”. (NOAA also got a proposed boost of around $500 million for its own line of weather and climate satellites.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite its budgetary struggles, NASA has managed to continue doing climate science in the past few years. It scraped together money to start work on a new instrument called Libera, which will launch in 2027 to measure solar radiation, so that the agency can maintain a crucial four-decade record of how much heat Earth’s atmosphere absorbs. But it hasn’t made the progress it would have liked on monitoring the designated observables. “Over the last year, we’ve been in an especially challenging environment with COVID,” says St. Germain.\n",
            "\n",
            "The agency has been trying to save money and speed things up by working with partners such as commercial companies. Sometimes that has worked well. For instance, the agency set up a programme to buy Earth-observation data from satellite companies and make the information available to NASA-funded researchers, to complement measurements from government satellites. At other times, NASA has been left in the lurch. For example, the agency planned several years ago to pay for a ride on commercial satellite launches for some of its spacecraft that needed to reach geostationary orbit, a relatively high vantage point above Earth. But then the commercial satellite operators changed their plans, leaving a pollution-monitoring spacecraft called TEMPO and a carbon-mapping mission called GeoCarb scrambling for new rides to space.\n",
            "\n",
            "If Congress approves a significant boost for NASA’s Earth-science division, then the agency might finally be able to accelerate progress on satellites to track climate change. The funding decision is expected in the coming months.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The switch in administration now means that we can actually start to implement some of these missions,” says Helen Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who studies Antarctic ice loss. “We can make up for lost time and get on with it.”\n",

            "“There absolutely is that challenge of continuing to make the case for a bold plan and an investment-led recovery. That will be the fight and we need to anticipate that, but it’s the winning argument,” said Bracken Hendricks with Evergreen Action, which was founded by advisers to Washington Gov.

            "\n",
            "In the plan’s top lines, Biden calls for decarbonizing the economy by 2050, though he advanced that deadline to 2035 for utilities following outside recommendations. It includes a strong environmental justice component to hold polluters accountable and route funding to communities overburdened by them, and it envisions creating jobs by investing in clean energy, clean transit and the manufacturing sector behind them.\n",
            "\n",
            "But many would require buy-in from Congress. That prospect that could be dead in the water if Republicans hold the Senate, while Biden’s plan might not go far enough for many in a Democratic-majority House.\n",

As early as the 1980s, oil companies knew that burning fossil fuels was altering the climate, according to industry documents reviewed at a 2019 U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing. Yet these companies, aided by some scientists, set out to mislead the public, deny well-established science and forestall efforts to regulate emissions.\n",

            "\n",
            "We wanted more than a neutral [label directing people to Facebook’s information page on climate change], but they wanted to test the neutral post first. That’s all good. It’ll be a few months at least for the testing in the U.K. phase to roll out, but we don’t yet know how many other countries they will roll it out to and when. We all came on board with the idea that they’re going to do more, and more aggressively. I’ll be pleasantly surprised if it rolls out globally. That’s my criteria for success.\n",

            "Scientists have been countering climate change misinformation for years, through fact-checking and debunking. It’s a bit like whack-a-mole. You advocate for “inoculating” people against the techniques that help misinformation spread through communities. How can that help?\n",
            "\n",
            "van der Linden: Fact-checking and debunking is useful if you do it right. But there’s the issue of ideology, of resistance to fact-checking when it’s not in line with ideology. Wouldn’t life be so much easier if we could prevent [disinformation] in the first place? That’s the whole point of prebunking or inoculation. It’s a multilayer defense system. If you can get there first, that’s great. But that won’t always be possible, so you still have real-time fact-checking. This multilayer firewall is going to be the most useful thing.\n",
            "\n",
            "You’ve both developed online interactive tools, games really, to test the idea of inoculating people against disinformation tactics. Sander, you created an online interactive game called Bad News, in which players can invent conspiracies and act as fake news producers. A study of 15,000 participants reported in 2019 in Palgrave Communications showed that by playing at creating misinformation, people got better at recognizing it. But how long does this “inoculation” last?\n",
            "\n",
            "van der Linden: That’s an important difference in the viral analogy. Biological vaccines give more or less lifelong immunity, at least for some kinds of viruses. That’s not the case for a psychological vaccine. It wears off over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "In one study, we followed up with people [repeatedly] for about three months, during which time they didn’t replay the game. We found no decay of the inoculation effect, which was quite surprising. The inoculation remained stable for about two months. In [a shorter study focused on] climate change misinformation, the inoculation effect also remained stable, for at least one week.\n",
            "\n",
            "John, what about your game Cranky Uncle? At first, it focused on climate change denial, but you’ve expanded it to include other types of misinformation, on topics such as COVID-19, flat-earthism and vaccine misinformation. How well do techniques to inoculate against climate change denialism translate to other types of misinformation?\n",
            "\n",
            "Cook: The techniques used in climate denial are seen in all forms of misinformation. Working on deconstructing [that] misinformation introduced me to parallel argumentation, which is basically using analogies to combat flawed logic. That’s what late night comedians do: Make what is obviously a ridiculous argument. The other night, for example, Seth Meyers talked about how Texas blaming its [February] power outage on renewable energy was like New Jersey blaming its problems on Boston [clam chowder].\n",
            "\n",
            "My main tip is to arm yourself with awareness of misleading techniques. Think of it like a virus spreading: You don’t want to be a superspreader.

            "The impacts vary around the globe, but scientists say Vanuatu can expect sea-level rise, extreme temperatures, and more powerful cyclones. These effects are already taking a toll.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cyclone Pam, which hurtled across Vanuatu in 2015, is the storm that most Ni-Vanuatu cite when it comes to extreme weather. One of the most powerful cyclones ever recorded in the Pacific, Pam caused immense destruction totalling at least 60 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.\n",
            "\n",
            "The World Bank estimates that climate change could force more than 143 million people from their homes by 2050, driving massive internal migration. Rather than a single catastrophic event like Cyclone Pam, this mass movement of people would build as weather extremes layer one disaster on top of the next, sapping livelihoods, weakening food security, and overwhelming villages like Marow.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pacific countries are tackling these threats in their own ways. The president of Kiribati, an atoll nation beset by rising seas, this year announced it would explore ways to raise its land. In 2018, Fiji developed national guidelines on relocating villages, and Vanuatu created policies governing disaster displacement caused by climate change – some of the first countries in the world to do so.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the question of who will pay for climate loss and damages in the world’s most vulnerable nations – countries least responsible for their causes – remains.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaking at a climate summit in 2018, Regenvanu, then the country’s foreign minister, announced plans to challenge governments and the fossil fuel industry using international law – to “shift the costs of climate protection”, as he put it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regenvanu has spent the ensuing months formulating his plan. He has created a task force of scientists, lawyers, and politicians in Port Vila to investigate legal avenues for a possible lawsuit. He has enlisted a law firm based in Guam, Blue Ocean Law, to work on a coherent strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Vanuatu, Regenvanu said, is “always building back after a cyclone or disaster”, locked in costly recovery despite contributing little to climate change.\n",

            "“Vanuatu is the country in the world which is most at risk from natural hazards according to the United Nations; we have been for many years. We are also a negligible polluter to greenhouse gases,” he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regenvanu’s plan is to make his case before the International Court of Justice, or ICJ, which settles disputes between nations. He and his team want the ICJ to issue an “advisory opinion” – legal advice that can inform international law – that confirms industrialised nations are responsible for loss and damage in countries like Vanuatu.\n",
            "\n",
            "The ICJ has issued 27 advisory opinions in its history, covering everything from territory disputes to the legality of nuclear weapons – but not a single one on climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Its advisory opinions are non-binding, but Regenvanu believes a favourable decision will have symbolic power, setting a legal precedent that any court in any country could then use.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We want, obviously, a decision that says, ‘yes, there are obligations by states that had been breached; there are grounds for damages to be paid by them who caused it’.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“It would be the basis for agreements between states, multilateral decisions, even trade agreements under national law,” Regenvanu said. “We want, obviously, a decision that says, ‘yes, there are obligations by states that had been breached; there are grounds for damages to be paid by them who caused it’.”\n",
            "\n",
            "In order to reach the ICJ, Vanuatu will have to find support at the UN’s General Assembly – one of the few entities, mainly UN bodies, authorised to request advisory opinions.\n",
            "\n",
            "This would require Vanuatu to seek majority support from member nations – a daunting political challenge. But as the links between carbon emissions, climate change, and disasters’ humanitarian impacts have become clearer, there could be enough support, said Hermann Ott, a lawyer who heads the German section of ClientEarth, a charity specialising in environmental law.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We have a much stronger public perception on that issue, because we are feeling the effects of climate change to a much greater extent,” said Ott, whose firm is not involved in Regenvanu’s planning. “That is why the chances are currently high that a majority will come together.”\n",
            "\n",
            "When The New Humanitarian visited Vanuatu in February, Regenvanu’s team was hoping his country would be ready to bring the argument to the General Assembly by the end of 2020. The coronavirus pandemic and national politics have upended these plans.\n",
            "\n",
            "In March, the government declared a state of emergency for COVID-19 and shut its borders. In the same month, Regenvanu’s political party was defeated in parliamentary elections.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now the opposition leader, Regenvanu hopes the current government will endorse his plan to challenge global polluters. Until that happens, however, everything is on hold.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, the pandemic has also put a pause on climate action worldwide. November’s COP26 climate summit was postponed until 2021, delaying a meeting in which countries were expected to commit to stricter emissions targets.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the meantime, however, damage from climate-linked disasters continues. In April, Cyclone Harold barrelled across parts of the Pacific, causing widespread damage in Vanuatu’s northern islands. The government estimates more than 40 percent of the population were affected, and some communities were isolated without aid for weeks. It was Vanuatu’s most powerful storm since Cyclone Pam.\n",
            "\n",
            "Violent storms like cyclones Harold and Pam may garner some headlines, but climate damages are often more subtle. Heat stress, changing rainfall patterns, and coastal erosion are already reducing agricultural yields, according to the government. Less food means less income for subsistence farmers, and greater health risks from malnutrition, childhood stunting, and non-communicable diseases.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sitting on a plastic chair in front of her home, the waves splashing against the beach a few steps away, Joyce Daniels, Jeffrey’s wife, remembered Cyclone Pam as the first time she “saw” climate change – no leaves were left on the trees.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the weather extremes go deeper: Her village was in the middle of the longest drought she could recall. Although it was the rainy season, not a drop had fallen from the sky for days.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even the diet has changed. Crops that once were plentiful – lettuce, tomatoes, and a sort of spinach called island cabbage – are now harder or impossible to grow because the weather has become erratic. “It is dying,” Jeffrey said of the island’s agriculture.\n",

            "Her family’s diet was once heavy on root crops and vegetables; now she buys rice, biscuits, and noodles. Her parents, she said, could always depend on the land: “They did not go to the market.”\n",

            "In one meeting, women from farming families worried they couldn’t send their kids to school because they couldn’t afford the equivalent of $170 in yearly school fees. The women agreed to cover the costs as a group – the community stepping in to provide because the land could no longer.\n",

            "\n",
            "Blocs of vulnerable countries have pushed for new funding to cover loss and damages. Vanuatu, for example, says it needs support for the resettlement of coastal communities, reconstruction after extreme storms, crop insurance, and local emergency response funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "But wealthy nations have opposed attempts to establish formal compensation for climate damages. This leaves low-income countries paying for disasters through national budgets and short-term humanitarian appeals, and funding recovery through development loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Green Climate Fund, the main pool for climate financing, has only allocated $23 million to Vanuatu, channelled through a single project. In contrast, the government estimates the damage from a single storm, Cyclone Harold, exceeded the equivalent of $440 million.\n",

            "\n",
            "Galvanising political support is just the first hurdle. If the ICJ were to consider the issue, Regenvanu and his team would need to prove the link between oversized emissions in one country and extreme weather damages in another.\n",

            "\n",
            "RBG did more to advance the cause of equality than any justice since Thurgood Marshall. Her life and career were defined by it. As a schoolgirl in Brooklyn, she objected to the fact that the boys went to woodshop while the girls sewed. As co-founder of the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project, she convinced the Supreme Court to rule, for the first time, that gender discrimination was unconstitutional (despite being led by a Chief Justice who had threatened to resign if a woman were appointed to the court). As a member of that court, she fought for voters’ rights (Shelby County v. Holder), comprehensive healthcare coverage (Burwell v. Hobby Lobby) and federalism (Bush v. Gore).\n",
            "\n",
            "She did it patiently and incisively, referring to her role in her ACLU cases as \"a kind of a kindergarten teacher… because the judges didn’t think sex discrimination existed.\" Showing how discrimination hurt men was often the tactic she used to generate empathy and understanding among the male judges she was dealing with.\n",

The impacts of global warming are deeply regressive, disproportionately hurting our poorest and most vulnerable communities. Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to 63 percent and 56 percent more pollution than they create. Our history of redlining has left low-income and minority communities dangerously exposed to extreme heat. Americans are far more vulnerable to climate disasters if they are poor, elderly, disabled, don’t own a car or can’t speak English. And during and after these events, the rich tend to leave and the poor tend to stay; poverty rates can climb by a full percentage point in areas hit by climate disasters.\n",

            "The Court’s insistence on immediate contest overlooks common characteristics of pay discrimination, [which] often occur, as they did in Ledbetter’s case, in small increments… Small initial discrepancies may not be seen as meet for a federal case, particularly when the employee, trying to succeed in a nontraditional environment, is averse to making waves… Pay disparities, of the kind Ledbetter experienced, have a closer kinship to hostile work environment claims than to charges of a single episode of discrimination.

We need to suppress the friendly fire even within the climate action community. I’ve been in meetings on the Green New Deal where environmental justice groups automatically view all business and industry as evil — and in D.C. conference rooms where well-meaning business people and policy wonks dismiss those environmental justice groups as liberal \"enviro\" fantasists.\n",
            "\n",
            "RBG’s guidance echoes Amory Lovins’ longstanding philosophy: \"If we focus on outcomes, not motives, we can achieve results that we all want, but for different reasons… If we simply do what makes sense without having to agree on why it’s important, we and our planet will be better off.\"\n",

EPA was probably the most prominent environmental case handled during RBG’s time on the Supreme Court — with the court ruling that carbon dioxide is subject to regulation by the EPA under the Clean Air Act.

            "In 2001’s Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, the trucking industry argued that the EPA should consider implementation costs when setting pollution limits. The court unanimously disagreed — because the statute contains several explicit \"bright line\" factors — without listing cost as one of them. If legislators wanted the EPA to consider cost, they would have said so; \"Congress doesn’t hide elephants in mouseholes,\" wrote RBG’s opera buddy, Antonin Scalia, on behalf of the court.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, with a planet on fire, it is worth considering that principle. As we have written before, the cost of climate inaction dwarfs the cost of action to point that it renders the latter meaningless in comparison. There is over $5 trillion in value-at-risk to U.S. assets under a middle-of-the-road global warming scenario — not including the cost of market volatility.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our country can clearly spend when it needs to (or Congress wants to); nearly $2.7 trillion in CARES Act funding approved within two weeks, $2.4 trillion to $3 trillion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the annual $1 trillion a year that our fossil fuel-burning power plants cost America, based on the federal government’s base-case estimates on the social cost of carbon.\n",

            "The cost of greening our economy seems quaint in comparison; $476 billion for comprehensive grid modernization, for example, or $11 billion for a nationwide network of EV fast charging stations.

But a company can be, and typically is, any of the following: a hierarchical social unit, a nested series of bank accounts, a tightly controlled brand identity, a stock-ticker symbol. A company, to paraphrase an ancient author who knew something about distributed organizations, is not one member, but many.\n",
            "\n",
            "It can be difficult even to say who controls a company. Most large corporations are led by a chief executive officer, who is hired and managed by a board of directors, who are in turn elected by shareholders. But the separation of powers here is not as clear-cut as it may seem: A board might be very pliant to the CEO, or nobody but management’s picks might run for a board seat. Under United States law, 99 percent of a company’s shareholders can vote against a director candidate, and—if nobody runs against that person—they still will win.\n",

            "This discussion matters because—as you have likely heard—a hedge fund named Engine No. 1 executed a soft coup last week against one of the country’s most powerful companies, ExxonMobil. Despite controlling .02 percent of Exxon, Engine No. 1 placed two activist investors on the oil company’s board of directors.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fund argued that Exxon is unprepared for decarbonization and the energy transition, and that it should slowly shift away from its fossil-fuel-dominated business model. Some of the largest institutional investors in the country, as well as a slew of smaller investors, agreed with the fund and voted to throw out a minority of the existing board.\n",
            "\n",
            "This vote is a landmark. It shows that major institutional investors, who have long goaded oil companies to do more about climate change, are ready to start punishing executives over their failure to act. And for their first target, investors chose ExxonMobil: the country’s largest oil company, the biggest spin-off of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil trust, and the palace at the center of Big Oil’s empire.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s monumental,” Nell Minow, the vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors and a longtime strategist in proxy fights, told me. “There’s never been anything like this … Engine No. 1 is the kid who said the king is not wearing anything.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Exxon got plenty of warning before the coup, and looking back, we can discern a supertanker’s worth of pride before the fall. When Darren Woods, Exxon’s CEO, met with Engine No. 1 in January, he seemingly brushed off many of its concerns. When Exxon’s favored candidates for the board started to lose last week, Woods paused the shareholder meeting for an hour and made pleading calls to major investors. He lost anyway.\n",
            "\n",
            "Losing has been something of a habit for Woods lately. If Exxon had been a dynamic, resilient company, if it were printing profits from its investments in Texas shale, then it would not have faced this rebellion. But the entire oil sector is underperforming; Exxon lost $22 billion last year, its worst performance in four decades. Among retail investors, Exxon is especially prized for the dividend it pays out to its shareholders every quarter; last year, for the first time since 1982, the dividend did not increase—and analysts have started to fret that the company may soon cut it, which has never happened before.\n",
            "\n",
            "What distinguishes dying companies from those that manage a turnaround, Minow said, is their failure to metabolize bad news. Exxon has, in its case, actively tried to suppress bad news; during the 1990s and 2000s, it was one of the largest and deepest supporters of climate denialism. The company’s insistence that oil will win the day reminds Minow of when the managers of Eastman Kodak refused to prepare for the arrival of digital photography.* “They said, ‘People will always want film,’” she told me, astonished. “A lot of companies are like Wile E. Coyote: They run off the cliff and they’re suspended for a bit and they don’t realize nothing is below them.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The current board—which, again, still consists mostly of management’s favored directors—will decide where the new activist directors serve. The board is divided into committees, including a compensation committee, an audit committee, and a nominating committee. “What committees do they put the new directors on? This is how we’re gonna know whether Exxon has gotten the message or not,” Minow said. If not, next year’s shareholders meeting could be even more eventful.\n",
            "\n",
            "Engine No. 1 prevailed because it won the votes of two different types of institutional investors: one old, one new. First, it attracted the support of large state-pension funds that try to act in the best interest of the entire market. Second, it won support from newer financial firms such as State Street and BlackRock, which sell large, popular, low-fee index funds that track much of the market. Because those companies sop up so much of professional Americans’ savings, and because they try to buy a little of every company, they own single-digit percentages of Exxon and can push it to act in the long-term interest of the broader market. (BlackRock, which has cast itself as the climate-concerned institutional investor, has also been pressured by activists to align its proxy votes with its green marketing.) Working together, these funds brought Exxon to heel.\n",
            "\n",
            "Which is a little weird. How many times have activists argued that capitalism is incompatible with solving climate change? Yet last week, Exxon’s shareholders—that is, the owners of capital—acted to rein in Exxon’s managers and insiders. Capital has apparently been recruited into the fight against climate change; Wall Street is, à la Mothra versus Godzilla, battling Big Oil. If that’s surprising, it shows how tangled the politics of decarbonization has become. And it shows the difficult line that the Biden administration has to walk as it tries to make decarbonization an inevitability.\n",

            "This is what the new climate fight looks like: a hip-hop artist with long black hair, starting Twitter debates, dropping mix tapes, making art and remixing the youth-driven social movements that have dominated the last five years. It looks and sounds like 20-year-old Xiuhtezcatl (pronounced Shoe-Tez-Caht).\n",
            "\n",
            "Social media—and the ease to connect and get organized—is erasing the invisible lines that separated Black Lives Matter, Me Too and Standing Rock, Xiuhtezcatl says in his new book, Imaginary Borders.\n",
            "\n",
            "“These moments, as you’re seeing right now, this intergenerational, multiracial uprising is transforming the ways in which we fight for justice,” says Xiuhtezcatl, who can deftly switch between mobilizing a social justice campaign on Twitter and dropping a new digital single on YouTube from his phone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Xiuhtezcatl has been stepping up to the mic to talk about climate change since he was 6 years old. He stepped up at age 9 to lead the third generation of Earth Guardians, an environmental activist program for kids. By his 12th birthday, he’d spent nearly a decade on the road when depression hit. The touring schedule and indifference of his peers took a toll on his hope that things could change, he says. He didn’t know how to cope with the emotion—until he discovered hip-hop.\n",
            "\n",
            "Music was the creative outlet to find his voice—a far cry from the sound of mostly white, mostly scientific men who have dominated the conversation on climate, he says. Music could move a younger audience, too. The vision hit him at a hip-hop show when he saw the raw, live energy of a young crowd dancing to the music. As a climate activist, he set out to create a new kind of movement, one that was “dripping in art, color and diversity.”\n",
            "\n",
            "He started writing lyrics, using voice memos in his phone. Many times, snippets of those phone recordings end up in the final mix: Little phrases, sentences and sounds that he records from his travels. Cover art for some of his digital singles—such as “Cell Phone” and “Piloncillo Freestyle”—feature smartphone photography, too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Xiuhtezcatl released his first album in 2018, collaborated with Jaden Smith on a single, and will release a mixtape and album later this summer that fuses climate change with trap beats. One YouTube fan commented on a recent music video:\n",

            "“We saw it at Standing Rock,” he says. “Because of mobile technology—because of social media—people were hearing about it in every corner of the world.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Standing Rock was a youth and social media–driven protest to stop the construction of a pipeline across sacred ground in the Dakotas. Now, they’re using social media to share photos of fracking fields that threaten poor communities, as well as share photos of families and children being held at the border while trying to escape extreme weather events in Mexico. Most people don’t associate those images with the climate fight, but Xiuhtezcatl does.\n",
            "\n",
            "Increasing studies out of Mexico and Colorado University have linked migration from Mexico to drought and extreme weather events, Xiuhtezcatl says. One study predicts that 10% of Mexicans ages 15–65 could move north because of the climate crisis.\n",

            "Last year, Xiuhtezcatl worked on one of the most impactful projects of his life, he says. The Indigenous Youth Leadership training camp brought together 30 young leaders from across the country to gather on sacred land, to learn about environmental justice, and to be out on the land and in the water. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group got together online and found new ways to connect.\n",

            "“I’ve done lessons to learn my traditional language on a video call with my cousin in Mexico, who I usually don’t even talk to that much on a regular basis,” says Xiuhtezcatl. “This moment is really demonstrating how young people are being creative with the ways we fight for social issues and maintain hope.”\n",

            "Mounting scientific evidence shows that the earth’s temperature is rising and is expected to trigger a domino effect of natural disasters. Like Hurricane Katrina in 2015, these disasters have historically had the greatest impact on poorer, Black and Brown communities, Xiuhtezcatl says.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We need strong leadership that is willing to defy what a lot of politicians are claiming as politically impossible,” says Xiuhtezcatl. “So, in the next 20 years, I pray to see the work be done by people, by politicians and by corporations to dismantle these harmful systems that threaten our survival, and to invest in the prosperity of our future. We can build a thriving, healthy, prosperous economy. It’s so possible. We have an opportunity here not just to stop the climate crisis, but to radically transform our communities and the way our government and our world interacts internally and externally, and I’m excited about that.”\n",

            "BERLIN (AP) — World leaders breathed an audible sigh of relief that the United States under President Joe Biden is rejoining the global effort to curb climate change, a cause that his predecessor had shunned.\n",
            "\n",
            "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were among those welcoming Biden’s decision to rejoin the the Paris climate accord, reversing a key Trump policy in the first hours of his presidency Wednesday.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Rejoining the Paris Agreement is hugely positive news,” Johnson wrote on Twitter. Britain, which is hosting this year’s U.N. climate summit, looked forward to working with the Biden administration on the issue, he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Macron likewise tweeted his joy at the U.S. rejoining the Paris pact, saying that with Biden, “we will be stronger to face the challenges of our time. Stronger to build our future. Stronger to protect our planet.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The accord, forged in the French capital in 2015, commits countries to put forward plans for reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which is released from burning fossil fuels.\n",
            "\n",
            "Former President Donald Trump had questioned the scientific warnings about man-made global warming, at times accusing other countries of using the Paris accord as a club to hurt Washington. The U.S. formally left the pact in November.\n",
            "\n",
            "By contrast, Biden put the fight against climate change at the center of his presidential campaign and on Wednesday immediately launched a series of climate-friendly efforts to bring Washington back in step with the rest of the world on the issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "“A cry for survival comes from the planet itself,” Biden said in his inaugural address. “A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear now.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Experts say any international efforts to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5C (2.7F), as agreed in the Paris accord would struggle without the contribution of U.S., which is the world’s second biggest carbon emitter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Italy said the U.S. return to the Paris accord would help other countries reach their own climate commitments. “Italy looks forward to working with the U.S. to build a sustainable planet and ensure a better future for the next generations,” Premier Giuseppe Conte tweeted.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Vatican, too, was clearly pleased given the decision aligns with Pope Francis’ environmental agenda and belief in multilateral diplomacy. In a front-page editorial in Wednesday’s L’Osservatore Romano, Vatican deputy editorial director Alessandro Gisotti noted that Biden’s decision to rejoin Paris “converges with Pope Francis’ commitment in favor of the custody of our common home.”\n",
            "\n",
            "German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more muted in her reaction, noting merely that her government would “probably have a more similar opinion” with Biden on issues such as the Paris climate accord, migration and the World Health Organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Merkel’s conservative Union bloc has close ties to the German auto industry that’s fought against tougher emissions rules for cars. Her potential successor, Armin Laschet, has defended the continued mining of coal in his home state even as Germany phases out the fossil fuel by 2038.\n",
            "\n",
            "Germany’s Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, of the center-left Social Democrats, voiced greater excitement at Biden’s move. “The U.S. is rejoining the fight against the climate crisis with great verve and enthusiasm,” Schulze said, adding that she hoped the new U.S. administration would use the upcoming global summit to “reinforce their pursuit of climate neutrality with a concrete intermediate target for 2030.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Youth activists who have been at the forefront of demanding leaders take the threat of global warming seriously said they now want to see concrete action from Washington.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Many countries signed the Paris Agreement and they are still part of the Paris Agreement, but they make very free interpretations of what that implies,” said Juan Aguilera, one of the organizers of the Fridays for Future movement in Spain. “In many cases, signing it has become a show, because at the end of the day the concrete measures that are being taken, at least in the short term, are not satisfactory.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Biden has appointed a large team to tackle climate change both on the domestic and international front. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, named as the president’s special climate envoy, on Thursday took part in a virtual event with Italian industry at which he touted the ‘green economy’ as an engine for jobs and said the U.S. planned to make up for time lost over the past four years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Organizers of a meeting Monday on adapting to climate change said they hoped Kerry would take part too, and Biden himself has talked about inviting world leaders to a summit on the issue within his first 100 days in office.\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the coming months the U.S. allies and rivals will closely watch to see by how much the administration offers to cut its emissions in the coming decade. A firm number is expected to be announced before the U.N. climate summit taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.\n",
            "\n",
            "(AP) - Facebook plans to end a contentious policy championed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg that exempted politicians from certain moderation rules on its site, according to several news reports.\n",
            "\n",
            "The company's rationale for that policy held that the speech of political leaders is inherently newsworthy and in the public interest even if it is offensive, bullying or otherwise controversial. The social media giant is currently mulling over what to do with the account of former President Donald Trump, which it “indefinitely” suspended Jan. 6, leaving it in Facebook limbo with its owners unable to post.\n",

But the inordinate emphasis on individual behavior is the result of a marketing campaign that has succeeded in placing the responsibility for fixing climate change squarely on the shoulders of individuals.Fossil fuel companies have followed the example of other industries deflecting blame (think \"guns don't kill people, people kill people\") or greenwashing (think of the beverage industry's \"Crying Indian\" commercials of the 1970s). Meanwhile, they've blocked efforts to regulate or price carbon emissions, run PR campaigns aimed at discrediting viable alternatives, and have abdicated their responsibility in fixing the problem they've created. The result has been disastrous for our planet.In The New Climate War, Mann argues that all is not lost. He draws the battle lines between the people and the polluters-fossil fuel companies, right-wing plutocrats, and petrostates. And he outlines a plan for forcing our governments and corporations to wake up and make real change, including: A common-sense, attainable approach to carbon pricing- and a revision of the well-intentioned but flawed currently proposed version of the Green New Deal;Allowing renewable energy to compete fairly against fossil fuelsDebunking the false narratives and arguments that have worked their way into the climate debate and driven a wedge between even those who support climate change solutionsCombatting climate doomism and despair-mongering With immensely powerful vested interests aligned in defense of the fossil fuel status quo, the societal tipping point won't happen without the active participation of citizens everywhere aiding in the collective push forward. This book will reach, inform, and enable citizens everywhere to join this battle for our planet.\n",

            "When I crunch the numbers, I face a blunt reminder that the impacts of a single person’s habits are minuscule with respect to a planetary-scale issue like climate change. To reverse climate change, humankind must stop adding carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and then remove 1,442 gigatons from the air by 2050, according to the 2017 book Drawdown, edited by Paul Hawken.\n",
            "\n",
            "My eyes blur with these terms and numbers, but “giga” refers to 1 billion, so a gigaton is 1 billion tons. Humans are currently adding roughly 36 gigatons of CO2 annually to the atmosphere. To put these colossal numbers into perspective, let’s look at the effects of individual actions in terms of tons of CO2 saved per year. The four most CO2-saving actions for people living in the United States are to have one fewer child, live car-free, avoid airplane travel, and eat a plant-based diet. For example, a single person living car-free in the United States saves more than three tons of CO2 per year, and eating a plant-based diet saves a bit more than one ton. Every American currently emits roughly 18 tons of CO2 on average per year. In order to reach safe climate goals by 2050, the U.S. per capita emissions need to drop to less than 2.5 tons of CO2 per year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Without question, the practicalities of reversing these trends are overwhelming. At the same time, cumulatively, small steps add up. Project Drawdown takes a sum-total-of-small-gains approach as it outlines 100 solutions to our climate predicament. Hawken and his colleagues have made careful calculations for lowering CO2 emissions, one sector of human society at a time. For example, replacing, avoiding leaks of, and safely destroying chemical refrigerants found in all refrigerators, supermarket cases, and air conditioners add up to the number one societal level change that we can make to reduce greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons used for cooling have a capacity to warm the atmosphere at rates that are 9,000 times greater than CO2. Increasing onshore wind turbines to account for 22% of our total energy use is the number two most effective societal change toward lowering CO2 emissions. In these ways, we take digestible bites out of the climate pie to achieve our goal.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the same time, personal changes are also important because they shift our collective mindset. In the late 1990s, I traveled to India. While there, I visited a co-housing community in Kerala, and over dinner, one of the residents told us a story about viral social change called The Hundredth Monkey. The version he told, which I have heard since, has taken on the form of a myth and exaggerates the real findings, and is based on a book of that name by Ken Keyes Jr. In the myth, a young female Japanese monkey on an island learned to wash a sweet potato in a stream to remove the dirt. She then taught the trick to her mother and slowly the practice spread. In subsequent years, all the monkeys in the troop adopted the practice. But when the hundredth monkey started washing its potatoes, the scientists noticed all the monkeys on the mainland and on neighboring islands were also washing their sweet potatoes. A critical mass had been reached, which led to a kind of behavioral convergence. There is real research behind the hundredth monkey phenomenon, but the results are less spectacular. It neither confirms nor denies that crossing a threshold led to the adoption of the practice everywhere. It does observe that when mothers adopt a practice and teach it to their children, that practice can become fixed in the next generation. Older monkeys — stuck in their ways — stay with what they’ve always done, eating food with dirt on it.\n",
            "\n",
            "My point is that we have to start somewhere, and changing behaviors one person at a time can and does influence social change. It’s important to make big changes, even if it’s just one thing. Choose a habit that requires passion to adopt. Personally, my life changed when I began biking to work in 2005. Not only did it keep me in shape; I’d like to think that over the years I have influenced a few people to bike commute themselves. But more than that, the days that I bike, I feel empowered.\n",
            "\n",
            "I am inspired by the stories of people who make a life change and do something extraordinary. Take Bren Smith of Bramford, Connecticut, who had once been an industrial fisherman, but now runs Greenwave, a nongovernmental organization that promotes ocean farming of kelp and shellfish. Smith’s model addresses climate change and our need to raise food sustainably. Kelp is fast-growing and very efficient at sequestering CO2 from the water. As CO2 rises in the atmosphere and is absorbed by the water, the oceans become more acidic, and acidic water degrades the little shells of plankton at the base of the marine food chain. But research shows that kelp can lower acidity locally in the ocean. By some estimates, if farmers covered as much as 9% of the ocean in kelp farms, we would draw enough carbon from the water to counter climate change. Smith’s 3D scaffolds of kelp, clams, oysters, and mussels help restore ecosystems and take the pressure off fish stocks while creating green jobs. Greenwave offers an ocean farmer training program to teach others to adopt the system. Of course, most people may start by making smaller personal changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "In his 2008 essay “Why Bother?” writer and food activist Michael Pollan advocates growing a garden as a first step to empowering us, changing mindsets, and igniting us toward a different (greener) way of living. The bigger point is less about how one personal change will reverse the juggernaut of climate change. It’s more about how each example of someone taking steps for a cause can add up to viral social change. It happened with the civil rights movement, starting with a spark when Rosa Parks defiantly refused to give up her seat in the front of a bus on December 1, 1955. The truth is that Parks was not the first African American — even that year — to defy racist bus laws. Nine months earlier, 15-year-old Claudette Colvin refused to give up her seat for a white passenger on March 2, 1955, and 18-year-old Mary Louise Smith did the same thing later on October 21, 1955. By the time Parks acted, some critical mass of commitment to change had been made throughout the United States, so the conditions were right for that spark to light a fire.\n",
            "\n",
            "Personal changes, innovation, and new laws are all required to save our planet. But most politicians — who control big funding that fuels innovation — are followers, not leaders. As Pollan pointed out, “For us to wait for legislation or technology to solve the problem of how we’re living our lives suggests we’re not really serious about changing — something our politicians cannot fail to notice. They will not move until we do.”\n",
            "\n",
            "And so, I come full circle to rethink a conversation I had in the 1980s. A conversation with a friend changed me, though the sad irony is how long it took. I recognize that my thinking in 2020 is idealistic, that humans as a collective are not fixing the problem of climate change and instead are fully headed in the wrong direction, but I remain optimistic. I now believe that social change can begin within each of us with one big personal commitment. With respect to the climate, we can each decide to grow a garden, bike to work, eat mostly plants, protest, or adopt some other meaningful action that can in turn influence the next person.\n",

That's when there will be United Nations talks in Glasgow, where about 200 governments will be asked to spell out what each is willing to do to keep the Earth from becoming a far hotter, more dangerous and less hospitable place.\n",

            "China, Japan and South Korea have all followed the European Union in pledging to cut emissions to “net zero” in recent weeks, where they release only as much as they remove from the air. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden made the same promise in his election campaign.\n",

            "Next year they are set to lay out the first practical measures to meet these targets, as part of commitments under the Paris climate accord, and putting a price on carbon will be front and centre, experts told Reuters.\n",

            "“Each country will have to come up with its own path to reaching net zero, but the expectation is carbon pricing is going to be a very important part,” said Wendy Hughes, Carbon Markets and Innovation Manager at the World Bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "The principle is simple: a carbon price establishes how much companies need to pay for their emissions. The higher the price, the greater the incentive to pollute less and invest in low-carbon technology.\n",

            "Governments can force these payments through a carbon tax - a levy companies must pay when they pollute - or through an emissions-trading system (ETS).\n",
            "\n",
            "An ETS sets a maximum cap on the amount of emissions that a sector, or group of sectors, can produce. It creates “carbon permits” for those emissions, which companies can buy for each tonne of CO2 they emit.\n",
            "\n",
            "More than fifth of global emissions are covered by 46 national carbon-pricing schemes operating today or in the planning stage, as well as 32 regional systems within countries, according to the World Bank.\n",

            "Since the European system was launched in 2005, emissions from participating power plants and factories have dropped by 35% – a sharper drop than seen in sectors not covered by the scheme.\n",

            "But the trick for these markets is to get the carbon price right. If it’s too low, there’s little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; too high, and risk knee-capping industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "The changes would involve including more sectors, such as shipping, and curbing the free permits given to EU industry to help it compete with overseas companies that don’t pay carbon costs.\n",

            "Other major economies are catching on. China, now the world’s top greenhouse gas emitter, plans to launch its own national ETS, possibly as early as next year.

Beyond bridges and roads, this program seeks to invest heavily in technologies and capabilities to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A clean electricity standard would phase out use of fossil fuels in generation of electrical, now at 63 percent, by 2035.

            "Buttigieg draws praise from many planners and elected officials. He's a \"guy who has a local resume and local experience who can talk the language of mayors,\" says Whit Blanton, FAICP, executive director of Forward Pinellas, the metropolitan planning organization for Pinellas County on Florida's gulf coast. \"I think we need more of that influence in our transportation policy and less state department of transportation influence.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "From his office in St. Petersburg, largest among the Pinellas County's 32 cities and towns, Blanton sees specific policy propels to advance alternatives. \"That is what transportation officials like me have been wanting to see for 10 years or more,\" he says. \"We can't continue this automobile dependence.\"\n",

            "In new infrastructure, the Biden administration's climate change agenda overlaps with social justice efforts, an intent to right past wrongs. The White House says a government-wide Justice40 Initiative has the goal of delivering 40 percent of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments to disadvantaged communities and tracks performance toward that goal through a new Environmental Justice Scorecard.\n",

            "In Pinnelas County, interstate highways constructed in the 1960s separate a predominantly Black community, an inequity that festers still.

            "In Nevada, Clark County Commissioner Justin Jones sees much the same thing — and it excites him. He reports that federal grant opportunities already advertised, typically reserved for large infrastructure, mention both environmental justice and climate as guiding criteria. They represent what Jones describes as a \"fantastic opportunity\" for metropolitan Las Vegas, which has a population of 2.3 million people sprawled across the Mojave Desert, largely unknitted by the light-rail systems that the civic peers of Las Vegas — Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Denver — already have.\n",

Her county of 2.5 million people has rising threats from both sea level rise and wildfires, the impacts of both coming more quickly than previously projected, she says.\n",

Though the mostly Black community had long been voicing concerns about the troubling quality of their drinking water, government officials assured them time and again it was safe.\n",

            "Two years and countless deferred complaints and organized protests later, it finally hit mainstream news that the residents of Flint have been drinking and bathing in water contaminated with lead levels several thousand times higher than the federal maximum, because local officials simply failed to use the legally mandated water treatments that would have kept them from being poisoned. As a result, all 9,000 children under six in Flint who have been exposed to the tainted water are at a high risk for neurological damage. The most recent data, as of March 2016, say the water still isn’t clean.\n",

They’re more likely to have toxic facilities sited near them, less likely to receive adequate protection to prevent disasters, and less likely to get the kind of immediate response White communities get when emergencies occur, says Dr. Beverly Wright, a sociologist and CEO of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice (DSCEJ) at Dillard University.\n",

            "“[Communities of color] are in double jeopardy” from the climate crisis,” she says. “First, if you’re a person of color, particularly Black or Latino, you’re more likely to live near toxic facilities, like petrochemical companies here in Louisiana, producing toxins that shorten and impact quality of life. And then, [our communities] are on the front line of impacts from climate change, living in places where there could be more floods and a higher incidence of different [climate-related] diseases. For poor communities, there’s also not having access to health insurance or medical services. Communities of color are disproportionately affected by all of these things.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s beyond time to do something about it. That’s why it’s so important to expand the conversation around climate justice — ensuring that all people, regardless of race and ethnicity, get equal protection from the worst effects of climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dr. Wright’s lifetime body of work shows a disturbing pattern — namely that people of color “are differently impacted by industrial pollution [and] can also expect different treatment from the government.”\n",

            "She and her peers have expanded their definition of environmental justice in recent years to include the term “climate justice,” since they say the same is true when it comes to polluting fossil-fuel facilities — communities of color experience worse effects and receive fewer protections than White communities.\n",

            "It was a case of history repeating itself: In 2009, 3.9 million tons of coal ash spilled from a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant. In the aftermath, the toxic coal ash was actually shipped more than 300 miles from the power plant site by train, where it was dumped in a landfill located in “rural and mostly Black Perry County, Alabama,” he says.

            "\n",
            "As state farmers see their fruit and vegetable crops shrink from lack of water, it’s the state’s majority-Latino farmworkers who are struggling most as a result, as they scramble to get enough hours picking crops to earn a livable wage.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Being a farmworker is a hard thing. Your average US citizen is nowhere near interested in doing that kind of work,” says Santoyo. “And when farmers don’t have enough water, they may adjust the number of acres they farm or the types of crops they harvest. In both cases, they need less labor.”\n",
            "\n",
            "So, he says, Latinos are first to be displaced from jobs, and they’ll often be among the last to recover economically. “When you look at farmers and developers, [the water crisis] has an impact on them without question. But also, a good proportion have the financial resources to adjust. Their world doesn’t end — not the way it hurts the Latinos.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Santoyo’s parents were farmworkers, and he worked in the fields himself as a youth. But many Latino parents, including his own, labor on farms so their children can have a better life. He and his siblings all went to college, and he says that’s the case for many farmworker families in California’s Central Valley.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, even Latinos who may not be struggling economically still find the water crisis impacting them disproportionately, says Santoyo. “In 2006, when we formed [the center], if you looked who makes decisions [about water] in the state of California, the one thing you would not have found were brown faces.”\n",
            "\n",
            "So the Coalition engaged with local and state legislators, drummed up community support, and regularly communicated with the state Latino Caucus. Today, thanks to these efforts, “there’s been some progress,” says Santoyo, “though it’s nowhere near where we want it to be.”\n",

            "One of the most important elements of climate-justice movement is the effort to ensure that communities of color get equal protection from their government officials from the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Nearly every expert we talked to pointed to the fallout from Hurricane Katrina as the poster-child example of climate injustice.\n",
            "\n",
            "It must be said that experts are uncertain just how much Katrina’s severity was tied to global warming. However, recent studies, including the IPCC’s 2013 climate change science report, have found that over the past 30 years, the intensity and duration of hurricanes have increased significantly, which may be due at least in part to the higher sea levels and warmer ocean temperatures caused by climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dr. Wright grew up in New Orleans, which has seen its share of stormy weather. But prior to Katrina, she says, hurricanes in her experience had just been synonymous with “heavy rain and a party” for her and her family.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then Katrina struck. The Category 5 hurricane came in from the east, over Lake Ponchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico, and hit the primarily African-American neighborhoods of New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward the hardest. Over 80 percent of the homes lost in Katrina belonged to African-American residents.\n",
            "\n",
            "To trace that history, you have to go back to 1965, the year the city experienced another devastating storm, Hurricane Betsy, which also swept through New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward, taking hundreds of lives, mostly Black.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the aftermath of Betsy, the city and state government naturally agreed that the levees protecting New Orleans from floodwaters needed to be shored up. But the money the federal government poured into post-Betsy recovery wasn’t distributed equitably.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Much of the money went to Lakeview, which is predominantly White, and not to areas where there were now no levees and would be flooded if there was another storm,” she says. “Since the levee boards are mostly made up of people in wealthy areas, those people were always on top of trying to get their properties protected.”\n",
            "\n",
            "As a result, a new plan to protect New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward — the neighborhoods hardest hit by Betsy — wasn’t even launched until nearly 30 years later, says Dr. Wright.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fast forward 40 years to 2005, when Hurricane Katrina was approaching the Crescent City, and the levees protecting White neighborhoods like Lakeview were “in place, extremely high, and supposed to withstand the storm,” she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "But as Katrina hit those same Black neighborhoods that had been devastated by Betsy, the levees protecting them were the weak points in the system. And they broke. “Our legislators forever and always had been protecting White people first,” she says. “Had they done it for everyone, it would have been a strong levee. But because they didn’t, the storm washed away the part that was supposed to protect them, too.” And so she watched the waters rise around and into her beautiful home in the upscale African-American neighborhood of New Orleans East. When she returned after evacuating, she says her community looked like a bomb had gone off. Though her house was still standing, everything inside was damp and covered with mold. She had to use a breathing apparatus just to pick her way through the wreckage, since high levels of lead, arsenic, and the carcinogenic benzopyrene contaminated the air and soil. As the keeper of her family’s photo archives, she was devastated to find that all of her treasured pictures were gone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although Black residents had been hardest hit by the storm, they once again found themselves shunted to the back of the line for government disaster assistance. In fact, they actually found themselves further victimized by it.\n",
            "\n",
            "“African-American New Orleanians watched with horror as the first rebuilding plans were presented to the city council,” she writes in The Wrong Complexion for Protection (New York Univ. Press, 2012). “The map clearly showed that the areas slated for immediate redevelopment were those that had received the least amount of water — areas where White citizens lived. The areas that were mostly inhabited by African Americans, specifically New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward, were not slated for redevelopment and were instead to be converted to green space.’ With one stroke of a pen, our land was being taken away and our inheritance lost.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, Dr. Wright and her colleagues at the DSCEJ provide legal assistance and run classes to help people learn their rights in dealing with climate and environmental disasters, and they also train people in skills needed to cope, such as mold and asbestos mitigation, weatherization, and green construction. While the center and other activists eventually helped funnel federal funds into and obtain local permission for rebuilding parts of the Lower Ninth Ward and New Orleans East, they continue to battle for equal protection from future Katrinas.\n",
            "\n",
            "The good news, Dr. Wright says, is that the levees have finally been strengthened all around, and the most vulnerable areas of the city are better protected now. But Bob Jacobsen, an engineer who worked on the eastside levees post-Katrina, cautions that they’re only engineered to national flood-insurance standards —n ot to protect against another Katrina.\n",

            "Green America published an issue of Green American dedicated to amplifying the voices of those on the front lines of the climate crisis, working to protect the most vulnerable areas around the world.

            "\n",
            "“People are saying we have to make sure that we make our communities more climate resilient, but it has to be a resilience that cuts across race, class, and geography,” says Dr. Bullard. “You can’t make one community resilient. If the weakest part breaks, then everyone is placed at risk.”\n",

            "\n",

In an e360 interview, she talks about the need to diversify climate science and activism and bring in the perspectives and energy of people of color and women.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ocean justice, as Ayana Elizabeth Johnson describes it, is where ocean conservation and issues of social equity meet: Who suffers most from flooding and pollution, and who benefits from conservation measures? As sea levels rise and storms intensify, such questions will only grow more urgent, and fairness must be a central consideration as societies figure out how to answer them, Johnson says.\n",
            "\n",
            "A marine biologist, Johnson is founder and CEO of the consulting group Ocean Collectiv and founder of Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank for coastal cities. Her concerns about social inclusion cover both race and gender. She has written about how racism slows climate action and has co-edited a forthcoming anthology of women’s writing on climate. The book, she says, is an effort to bring female voices to the center of a conversation that has too often been dominated by men.\n",
            "\n",
            "In an interview with Yale Environment 360, Johnson describes the links between climate change, racial justice, gender equality, and the oceans. “There is a gender aspect to who gets hit hardest by climate change,” she says. “At the same time, we look to who is continually being held up as the thought leaders on climate. In the U.S., it’s often a very small group of white men. They will never represent the full spectrum of perspectives on solutions.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson points to polling data that shows Black and Latino people are more concerned about climate change than whites. The climate movement’s failure to engage them in climate action, she says, “is a losing strategy, because you’re not reaching out to the people who already care.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Ayana Elizabeth Johnson: Ocean justice is where ocean conservation and social justice intersect. If we think about where is the water the most polluted, who gets impacted by storms, who is most dependent on the ocean and suffers when there’s overfishing, it often is poor communities and communities of color along the coastline. When we think about ocean conservation, it can’t just be for the spots in front of fancy resorts or the homes of wealthy individuals. We should also be thinking about not just who bears the brunt of the impacts on the ocean, but who gets the benefit when we do take care of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: It depends who you are. If you’re a conservation group, that starts with looking at your portfolio projects and assessing who they benefit, who you’re including in the development of your strategies, who you’re prioritizing, where resources are going.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there’s the policy level. For example, there’s a lot of NIMBY-ism when it comes to renewable offshore energy. All these wealthy communities on Cape Cod or Martha’s Vineyard or in the Hamptons don’t want wind turbines offshore, even though they’re now so far offshore that you can’t really see them. The power lines that come on shore are six inches in diameter and buried 20 feet below the surface. They’re still saying, “We don’t want that here,” even though they’re communities that often support environmentalism more broadly. That just really needs to shift.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: Sea level rise is a challenge that is so big that most people aren’t dealing with it. But it’s not going away. We need to be really creative and face this head on. The sea level is not going to rise inches. It’s going to rise feet, or potentially multiple meters by the end of this century. On top of that, you’re going to have storm surges and high tides. That’s going to completely change what’s possible and where along the coastline. Of course, poor communities — and many communities of color are poor, because of the history of racism in development — they’re the ones who have the fewest resources to move. They’re the ones who are most often in harm’s way. Low-income housing is often built in flood zones. There’s certainly a justice issue with how we deal with sea level rise.\n",
            "\n",
            "There’s also a justice element when we think about which communities get protected with sea walls, which communities have the resources to simply fortify their coast with barriers that shift the impacts downstream or down current.\n",
            "\n",
            "And we need to think about how to move people out of harm’s way. There’s going to have to be some very hard conversations about what it looks like to relocate entire communities, entire towns. You have generations of deep cultural ties to a place and to that bit of coastline. But it’s simply not going to be safe and viable to continue living there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: I don’t think people are aware of how large a role the ocean plays in the climate system. That ocean currents and temperatures actually affect the climate. That a warmer ocean makes for stronger hurricanes. That warm waters shift ocean currents, which can change the climate in whole continents. That the ocean has actually already absorbed 90 percent of the heat we’ve trapped by burning fossil fuels, and absorbed about a third of the CO2 we’ve emitted. When we don’t think about that, we’re just not thinking about the whole problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "We’re also not thinking about all the solutions. We need a flip of the script from seeing the ocean as this victim of overfishing, pollution, and warming to seeing it also as the hero when it comes to climate solutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: Solar and wind energy can be deployed offshore. Government analysis shows installing wind energy from Maine to Maryland could basically power the Northeast as well as providing 36,000 jobs. That is important especially in areas that are really densely populated, where there just aren’t swathes of empty land for putting in solar panels and wind turbines.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another area is coastal ecosystems. Wetlands store five times more carbon in their soils than a forest on land does. They’re very powerful for carbon sequestration, and for protecting us from stronger storms. Coastal ecosystems can actually be more effective than seawalls as well as less expensive. Not just protecting them, but also restoring them, is a key part of the menu of ocean solutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there’s regenerative ocean farming, which is just starting to burgeon. That’s very similar to the philosophy of regenerative farming on land. The ocean is actually even more environmentally friendly because it doesn’t require any fresh water or fertilizer or pesticides. Regenerative farming is not fish. It’s the seaweeds and oysters and mussels and clams. All these things that don’t need to be fed, they just live off of sunlight and the nutrients that are already in the water. And in some cases, they’re absorbing excess nutrients that are running off of land because of the use of fertilizers in agriculture, and which might otherwise contribute to dead zones.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: There’s the personal level on which it’s very hard to focus on the climate crisis when you’re dealing with the crisis of state-sanctioned violence and mass incarceration, and your friends and family being at risk for being murdered by the police for no reason, and fighting for your basic rights to live and breathe. That is the priority, unfortunately, for many communities, which means there are people who are not able to focus on being a part of climate solutions even though they care. Addressing the climate crisis will take the biggest team possible. Anything that hinders people from bringing their full intellect and creativity and force to solutions is a problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: For sure. The mindset of domination over nature — manifest destiny and trophy hunting and all of these kinds of things — is quite a white construct. It has created this scenario where we feel detached from nature as opposed to understanding that we are fundamentally dependent on it. That’s how capitalism created and dominated by white people has gotten us into this mess. There are the executives at fossil fuel companies who knew in the 1970s from their own scientists that burning fossil fuels could cause climate change and decided to prioritize their profits instead. Those were all white men. Another manifestation of this is the fascination with geo-engineering, which is certainly something that follows that same supremacy over nature approach. That assumes that more climate change is the answer. We need a mindset of more Indigenous ways of living in harmony with nature, as opposed to attempting to dominate and manipulate it.\n",
            "\n",
            "We know from social science research that white men have a much higher tolerance for risk because things tend to work out for them. That is actually putting all of us at risk because these dangerous decisions are being made. We can’t just all hunker down into bunkers and be okay. Climate change is a global problem and it’s coming for people of color and poor people first. But in the end, it’s coming for all of us. No matter how wealthy you are, you still need to eat — we’re shifting the climate in ways that disrupt and endanger our food security. No matter how privileged you are, the storms are still coming, the heat waves are still coming.\n",
            "\n",
            "e360: You’ve talked about people of color being more supportive of climate action than white people. Why has the climate movement failed to recognize that, and what’s lost by not including people of color in the conversation about climate?\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: There’s been this very effective mythology around the white, rugged, outdoorsy environmentalist being the average environmentalist when in fact communities of color have always been close to nature and caring for it and concerned about it. I wish more people knew that. Even I had no idea that there was such a gap in terms of percentage points until I read the polling by Yale and George Mason that showed 49 percent of white people are concerned about climate change, compared to 57 percent of Black people and 70 percent of Latinx people. Failing to prioritize engaging people of color is a losing strategy, because you’re not reaching out to the people who already care.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fascinating thing is the reason the Latinx community is far and away the most concerned about climate, it’s associated with having more egalitarian world views and a stronger sense that your community, your friends, your family expect you to do something. Not just to know about it, but to be a part of the solution. It’s really interesting when we think about the societal and cultural shifts that are going to be needed to address this problem. Solving the climate crisis is not just an engineering problem. It’s a social norm problem as well. We have to shift what we expect and how we see the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "e360: You co-edited [with Katharine Wilkinson] a forthcoming anthology of women’s climate writing [All We Can Save: Truth, Courage, and Solutions for the Climate Crisis], and you argue that the climate crisis is not gender-neutral. How so?\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: In a lot of places in the world, women are primarily responsible for getting water, for maintaining gardens. Those are all things that become harder and more difficult because of our changing climate. After natural disasters — or increasingly unnatural disasters — it’s often women who are most at risk. There’s a lot of sexual violence associated with these scenarios. Also women turning to sex work which they wouldn’t otherwise have gotten into because of food scarcity. Girls getting married off younger because their families are so financially constrained because of the ways climate is impacting them. There is a gender aspect to who gets hit hardest by climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the same time, we look to who is continually being held up as the thought leaders on climate and what the solutions are. In the U.S., it’s often a very small group of white men. They will never represent the full spectrum of perspectives on solutions. Different perspectives determine what scientific questions are even being researched. So understanding the problem and its impact, and understanding what solutions are going to be most effective, really requires that we diversify the field. Women being left out means we’re losing half of the brain power of the planet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johnson: Despite all the barriers that sexism has created, there are so many incredible women doing critical work. When we think about the youth climate movement and the climate strikes, the leaders of that are teenage girls. It’s not driven by ego. They are repeating what’s working from country to country. They’re learning from each other. There’s been an amazing community and network that’s been created. It’s so beautiful to imagine what could happen if we thought more in terms of relationships and community as opposed to technological solutions and single leaders. And if we thought about the roles we can each best play in solving a problem that could not be more fully an “all hands on deck” situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The way society suppresses men’s expression of emotion is really hard, because we’re dealing with a very scary existential threat. When I read scientific reports and read the news about climate, I’m often brought to tears by these terrifying projections of the future. We need to be able to have an emotionally intelligent response, as opposed to shutting down the fear and grief and rage.\n",

(Thank you, by the way.)\n",

            "But that focus seems to have slipped in the global warming era. Liberty Mutual recently received the lowest grade of 30 global insurance companies from Insure Our Future, a group of climate change campaigners. It refused even to answer the questionnaire the group sent, and probably for good reason. Among other things:\n",
            "\n",
            "⋅ Liberty Mutual has devoted almost 10 percent of its investments in precisely the fossil fuel companies driving the climate crisis, and those investments include the very dirtiest companies: TC Energy, for instance, which is trying to build the Keystone XL pipeline from the tar sands of Alberta, over the strenuous objections of indigenous communities and Midwest farmers.\n",
            "\n",
            "⋅ It insures many of the most egregious projects — the Transmountain pipeline, another massive straw sucking the filthiest oil on earth out of Canada and shipping to the Pacific to be sold to Asia, or the Mariner East pipeline in Pennsylvania so that fracked gas can be shipped to Scotland to make plastics.\n",
            "\n",
            "⋅ Its subsidiaries are just as dirty. Liberty Metals and Mining Holdings, for instance, is pressing ahead with a new coal mine in Queensland, Australia, even as bush fires rage across the continent and the Great Barrier Reef begins to disintegrate in the hotter, more acidic seas that come with global warming.\n",
            "\n",
            "Liberty Mutual should follow the lead of others in the insurance industry. Some have begun to move more aggressively on climate change, halting investments in coal and tar sands, and refusing to insure the aggressive expansion of the industry. That makes sense: Insurance companies own the piles of data that prove the existential threat to life and property climate change poses. Chubb, for instance, another American insurance giant, declared in July that it would stop insuring new coal-fired power plants or companies that made most of their money from coal; it would even stop investing its premiums in coal companies. That’s a modest step — it still leaves oil and gas untouched. But it also leaves Liberty Mutual in the dust.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Chubb recognizes the reality of climate change and the substantial impact of human activity on our planet,” said Evan G. Greenberg, chairman and CEO of Chubb. “Making the transition to a low-carbon economy involves planning and action by policy makers, investors, businesses, and citizens alike. The policy we are implementing today reflects Chubb’s commitment to do our part as a steward of the Earth.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Liberty Mutual obviously has access to the same data on the risks of global warming — it aggressively attempted to cancel homeowner policies for those near wildfires spawned by ever-deepening drought and ever-higher temperatures. A Liberty Mutual spokesperson called dropping policies and raising rates a “necessary step to responsibly manage our overall exposure to wildfires.” Or as account representative Clifton Padgett explained, “nothing against the policyholder; it’s just a business decision.” California has since banned this practice, at least temporarily.\n",

That culture of risk management should make them leaders, not followers, in the climate fight. After all, it’s not as if the core of its business is at stake: There are a lot of investments to insure that aren’t pipelines and coal mines. Compared to, say, a homeowner who can’t find insurance, shifting the company’s portfolio away from fossil fuels is a minor trauma.\n",
            "\n",
            "Instead of helping, though, Liberty Mutual has so far chosen to profit from the climate crisis. In 2008, the company launched an insurance product designed to cover corporate boards of directors in the case of climate change litigation. Let’s hope they purchased a policy for themselves.\n",

            "At the latest Democratic debate on Sunday, Joe Biden wanted to make it clear that, when it comes to climate change, he's got the record that makes him the better candidate. He referenced being one of the first senators to introduce a climate change bill back in 1986, adding, twice, \"PolitiFact said it was a game changer.\" He also brought up the biggest climate policy accomplishment of the Obama administration, the Paris Climate Agreement, which Donald Trump has bailed on. \"I would immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord, which I helped put together,\" Biden said on Sunday.\n",
            "\n",
            "But history tells a different story. Take the game changing Global Climate Protection Act, which Biden introduced as a senator representing Delaware in the 80s. In PolitiFact's write-up of the debate, the fact-checking website denied ever calling the plan \"a game changer.\" Reed College history professor Josh Howe told PolitiFact that while it may have been the first Senate bill to address climate change, it was still meager, saying, \"It was a plan to make a plan. Which, of course, neither Reagan nor Bush ultimately did.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "As far as the Paris Agreements, Biden has often touted his effort to help make the non-binding global deal a reality. At a late February campaign stop in South Carolina, he said, \"I'm the guy that came back after meeting with Deng Xiaoping and making the case that I believe China would join if we put pressure on them. We got 200 nations to join.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Deng Xiaoping was a Chinese politician who died in 1997. Biden perhaps meant current Chinese president Xi Jinping, but it's hard to be sure since it's not actually clear that Biden was involved at all in the Paris Agreement. E&E News, which reports on energy and environmental issues, spoke with six White House and State Department officials from the Obama administration, all of whom said that if Biden played a role, they weren't aware of it at the time. At least one of those officials said, \"I really don't think he was involved at all.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Biden was more involved in foreign policy, with climate change implications, on Ukraine, however. In 2014, after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula, Biden helped spearhead a $50 million aid package that included support for developing Ukraine's shale gas infrastructure. The goal was to get the country off of Russian oil dependency by ramping up its own fossil fuel production. Unfortunately, the aid did that by helping Ukraine dramatic expand its own fossil fuel production at a time when countries needed to be restricting carbon emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under the Obama administration, fossil fuel production in the U.S. soared. Days after the Paris Agreement was signed, Obama signed an omnibus bill that lifted a ban on crude oil exports, paving the way for the U.S. to eventually export more than 3 million barrels a day. Biden bragged about the American crude surging into foreign markets, saying in a 2016 speech, \"For the first time, gas from the United States is being used here in Europe.  And every country in Europe can now buy that American resource.\" As of late 2018, the U.S. became the largest exporter of crude oil in the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "His presidential campaign has an equally murky track record when it comes to trying to balance fossil fuel interests and climate action. co-chair for the Biden campaign representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana has the most pro-fossil fuel industry voting record of any Democrat in Congress, according to Sludge. And Heather Zichal, an informal adviser to the Biden campaign, helped write some domestic climate policy under the Obama administration, and she also headed an interagency group established via executive order to encourage \"unconventional\" oil and gas development—work that eventually freed up Shell to drill in the Arctic. Between working for Obama and now Biden, Zichal served on the board of natural gas exporting company Cheniere Energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zichal told Reuters last May that Biden's climate change plan would represent \"a middle ground\" approach to the crisis. That approach is reminiscent of the Obama administration's \"All-of-the-Above\" energy policy, which promoted natural gas as a \"bridge fuel\" between more carbon-intensive energy sources like coal and carbon-neutral ones like solar and wind. In reality though, the development of natural gas infrastructure hasn't led to more renewable energy—it's just made natural gas a bigger share of the U.S.'s energy use.\n",
            "\n",
            "In that vein, Biden has resisted calling for a ban on fracking, a controversial method of natural gas extraction, but he briefly seemed to pivot on that at Sunday's debate. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is falling further behind Biden in the delegate count, said that he was calling to end \"fracking as soon as we possibly can,\" adding that he was \"talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet—no ifs, buts, and maybes about it.\" Shockingly, Biden said, \"So am I. No more—no new fracking.\" He added, \"No more drilling on federal lands.\" A spokesperson for the Biden campaign clarified to the Wall Street Journal that the former vice president was referring to his campaign promise to end drilling in federal lands and he does not support a ban on fracking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Biden's pitch for his climate policy is that it's the most realistic. That's true in a sense—it offers the fossil fuel industry the least disruption and headache possible while gently trying to reduce carbon emissions. But his plan doesn't seem realistic in terms of actually fighting climate change, especially in light of the fact that the standards for the Paris Agreement aren't enough to keep global temperatures from rising above a disastrous threshold in the next decade—and many countries are failing to hit those already-insufficient reductions. Biden hasn't taken criticism of his positions well so far. At least twice, his response has been to tell critics to vote for someone else.\n",

            "“I feel strange when I get applauded by people in power … because it’s obvious that it’s them I’m criticizing, but they can’t show that in front of the cameras,” she said. “It’s quite funny sometimes.”\n",

            "“I am not traveling like this because I want everyone to do so,” said Thunberg. “I’m doing this to sort of send the message that it is impossible to live sustainable today, and that needs to change. It needs to become much easier.”\n",

            "Joe Biden will not have an easy time rapidly transitioning the United States to a clean economy, as he has promised with highly ambitious targets such as a clean power grid by 2035. The new President’s path to doing so is rife with hurdles: a Congress in which Republicans can still block lots of legislative efforts, a judiciary dotted with Donald Trump’s appointments and the prioritization that COVID-19 will require in Mr. Biden’s early months on the job.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the flurry of executive orders Mr. Biden issued as he began his presidency this week, the manner in which he is structuring his administration and the massive investments that he is promising are already sending a signal that should reverberate in political backrooms and executive boardrooms around the globe.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s not just that he is willing to ruffle some feathers with domestic policy decisions that hurt fossil fuel interests foreign and domestic – as Canadians understandably frustrated by his abrupt cancellation of the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline can attest.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, the White House will not only join the effort, but wield its moral authority to expedite it in a way that it hasn’t even under previous Democratic occupants. And that could not come at a more pivotal time, as countries prepare a postpandemic economic rebuild, in the same year that their leaders will meet to set new emissions-reduction targets to replace those in the Paris Agreement.\n",
            "\n",
            "The pressure will be especially acute in Canada, which tends to judge itself against its behemoth neighbour. For the past four years, Mr. Trump’s complete disinterest made Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the continental leader on climate policy. If anything, Mr. Trudeau had to be concerned about hurting Canada’s competitive position by moving too quickly.\n",
            "\n",
            "And politicians of all stripes, as well as leaders of industries resistant to the climate transition, need to take note of who, in particular, is leading the U.S. into this new era of action: a President who, over the course of his long career, has built a reputation not as an activist, but as a cautious pragmatist who adapts to the world’s shifting demands and expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also a pragmatist, but generally perceived to have more modern sensibilities, Mr. Obama managed to include a decent assortment of clean-energy measures in his Great Recession stimulus package shortly after taking office in 2009. But his administration did not make climate a central focus in its early days, with health care and other priorities topping it, and the U.S. oil and gas sector boomed under his watch. Only later, in his second term, did Mr. Obama start to aggressively use executive action to impose new environmental rules.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Biden took that sort of action within hours of his inauguration. His initial climate orders largely involve instructing government agencies to reinstate environmental policies that Mr. Trump gutted. And they do so with great urgency in timelines and strong hints of instituting measures more ambitious than the ones previously in place.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, while the Keystone XL cancellation got the most attention in Canada, many of the other moves stand to have repercussions in this country as well, hinting at their far-reaching consequence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among them are new fuel-efficiency requirements for vehicles, which Mr. Biden has asked government agencies to determine by July of this year, after Mr. Trump weakened them. That stands to cause automakers to immediately start attaching a higher priority to improving the environmental performance of their North American fleets. It will be a welcome development in Ottawa, which has long aligned with Washington on vehicle regulation owing to the auto sector’s cross-border integration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Back in the Obama era, all three North American countries set a target of reducing leaks of the highly potent greenhouse gas (primarily from the fossil fuel sector) by 40 per cent to 45 per cent by 2025. The U.S. has recently made no serious effort to meet that goal, as Mr. Trump softened Mr. Obama’s stringent inspection and enforcement rules for new oil and gas operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Mr. Biden’s order not only suggests that those rules will be reinstated; it also calls for new methane rules for older facilities, which is more contentious with the industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "That could ultimately mean U.S. methane reductions beyond 50 per cent. If so, it will push the federal government here – which so far has been able to coast on coming closer to the initial targets than the Americans, but is on pace to fall well short of them – to do likewise if it wants to keep Canadian oil and gas competitive.\n",
            "\n",
            "But perhaps most telling of the comprehensiveness with which Mr. Biden intends to approach the climate fight is his rapid re-establishment of something called the “social cost of carbon.” It’s a way of putting a price on damages caused by emissions, then factoring that into the cost-benefit analysis for all government regulations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Established by Mr. Obama, the metric was reduced under Mr. Trump to the point of being meaningless. Now Mr. Biden has ordered a new interim version of it within a month, and a final version of it within a year, with all signs pointing to a much higher figure, and thus a formula for more stringent environmental rules of all forms.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is also striking about the social cost plan is who is tasked with working on it immediately, despite all the other things on the new administration’s plate: a group led by top economic and budgetary advisers to the President, and featuring senior representatives of pretty much every government department.\n",
            "\n",
            "That’s just one of the many indications of Mr. Biden’s whole-of-government approach to a climate fight that, until recently, tended to be hived off to officials specifically tasked with matters environmental.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another is that, based on their records of service or their confirmation hearings, many of the new President’s key cabinet appointees – such as Jennifer Granholm at Energy, and Pete Buttigieg at Transportation – have been chosen in large part for their perceived ability to advance climate-friendly policy. Similarly, the White House’s top staff ranks are now filled with people considered strong on the issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many other countries’ governments might point out that they’ve already gone that holistic route, before the U.S. has gotten around to it. They include Mr. Trudeau’s, with the Prime Minister’s recent mandate letters underscoring that he expects climate considerations to enter into most of his ministers’ thinking.\n",
            "\n",
            "It would be extremely fair for allies in the climate fight to chafe at the Americans suddenly trying to position themselves at the front of the pack. They could reasonably adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward whether Mr. Biden is able to steer a green spending package through Congress that, if not quite his promised US$2-trillion, is at least able to match the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed by European countries. Or cut into the lead that China, despite an extremely mixed environmental record, has built in clean-tech development. Or, in Canada’s case, whether the U.S. can make up for its lack of a national carbon tax with equivalent policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Welcome though it may be that Mr. Biden has already signed his country back into the Paris Agreement, his aspiration of shaping the new global accord to replace it – including through the high-profile appointment of John Kerry as his climate envoy, and plans for a U.S.-led summit in the coming months – will more easily be met if he quickly shows signs of overcoming his domestic obstacles.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the reality is that, diminished as America’s international reputation may be after four years of Mr. Trump, the climate fight won’t be won without Washington’s buy-in. The planet needs U.S. economic might, industrial ingenuity and consumer power. And it needs the bully pulpit that only one politician in the world enjoys.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, too, should the fact that it’s not some environmental radical who has lucked into the Oval Office, but an elderly member of the political establishment who has typically moved with the centre of the political spectrum. The takeaway for everyone else should be that if they can’t keep up with Mr. Biden in reorienting the economy, they’re going to be left behind.\n",

However, critics say the time for half measures is over and warn that failure to take dramatic action now will only necessitate even more expensive measures in the future.\n",

            "Many Americans don’t really know what the Green New Deal actually says, outside of a few deliberately misconstrued talking points. However, it’s not necessarily likely voters would easily warm to it if they did. The resolution is ambitious, calling for sweeping changes not just to the nation’s climate and energy policies, but its entire economy. The Green New Deal calls for an enormous investment in clean energy jobs and infrastructure, all but decarbonizing the American experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "That would mean, according to the Green New Deal, 100 percent renewable electricity in the U.S. within the decade — a goal that even sympathetic activists find difficult to imagine. And that’s easier than decarbonizing things like the transportation industry. The electric car is gaining popularity, but banning gasoline and diesel sales within ten years is a tall order even before you get to the issues of heavy transport and aviation. All that entails a seismic change in the economy, which the Green New Deal anticipates with a federal jobs guarantee, a feature of the Deal that enjoys the most popular support while simultaneously being maybe the most practically difficult to implement.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Green New Deal isn’t the only option Americans have, but it has been the most high publicity attempt at shifting the conversation away from what’s politically possible to what’s practically necessary. Alternatives exist, but the Green New Deal is illustrative of just why these proposals are so often dead on arrival. The plan is expensive. Public will is fickle. Radical political action is seen as impolite.\n",

            "Most American politicians were happy enough to give teenage Swedish climate activists Greta Thunberg a few minutes to testify before Congress, but the political interest in actually taking any action commensurate with her urgency is virtually nonexistent. That’s why, according to Lowe, dramatic action is necessary.\n",

            "“This is an emergency. It’s a crisis,” he says. “It’s become a worse crisis because we dragged our feet. We waited too long. We’ve been so comfortable and happy with the progress and the comforts that fossil fuels and our current economic systems have brought us. And so, we’re starting to face calls for bigger change, faster change. And we need to take those calls seriously.”\n",

            "“I don’t think we should pin our hopes to the Green New Deal or anything like that,” he says. “But I also don’t think we should write anything off just because it seems more aggressive or ambitious than we think is realistic. We need to be aggressive and ambitious.”\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the point he returns to again and again. Christians get to dream big when it comes to thinking about climate change.

            "“If [saving the climate] is the right way to live, then we should be having a serious conversation about how we get there,” Lowe argues. “Not saying, ‘Oh, that’s just not feasible.’ As Christians, I think we get to be among the most audacious people on the planet because we believe in a God in which all things are possible.”\n",

            "President Joe Biden’s bid to tackle climate change is running straight through the heart of the U.S. oil and gas industry -- a much bigger, more influential foe than Democrats faced when they took on the coal industry during the Obama years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Coal dominated U.S. power generation for decades, with the bulk of that fuel coming from the massive strip mines of Wyoming’s Powder River Basin — a market that collapsed in recent years as utilities switched to natural gas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fast forward to 2021 — and oil and gas have eclipsed coal to become the biggest human source of greenhouse gas emissions from public lands and waters, federal production data indicates. That’s made government fuel sales an irresistible target for Democrats as they try to rein in climate change.\n",

            "Biden’s election has put big oil companies on the defensive after largely having their way in Washington under President Donald Trump.

            "The industry is also deeply enmeshed in local economies -- from Alaska and the Gulf Coast to the Rocky Mountain drilling hub of Casper, Wyoming -- posing a challenge to the Democrat as he tries to navigate between strong action on the climate and recovering from the pandemic's financial devastation.\n",

            "“They expected this....They prepared for it,” said University of Oklahoma Associate Professor Robert Lifset, who teaches history of the U.S. energy industry. “But the difference now is going to be stark.

            "Just a week after his inauguration, Biden announced the sales moratorium while officials review potential climate impacts and whether energy companies are paying enough. He's following a familiar template -- a 2016 Obama-era moratorium on federal coal sales that Trump and other Republicans seized on as evidence of a “war on coal”by Democrats.\n",
            "\n",
            "That last “war” was against a retreating army: Coal production in Wyoming peaked in 2008 — and by the time of the moratorium, most major coal companies had gone bankrupt and scuttled plans for major expansions.\n",

            "Oil and gas companies and their supporters gave about $136 million in the last election cycle, mainly to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

            "Even with Trump gone, the oil and gas industry still has formidable allies in Congress, who say the moratorium would cost tens of thousands of jobs. Republican Sens.

A final vote is expected Monday.\n",

            "Like Kirkwood Oil & Gas, companies could respond by shifting some of their activities onto private lands in the U.S., and more oil would likely come in from overseas, said economist Brian Prest, who examined effects of a long-term leasing ban for the research group Resources for the Future.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a result, almost three-quarters of the greenhouse gas emission reductions from a ban could be offset by oil and gas from other sources, said Prest. The net reduction would be about 100 millions tons (91 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide annually.\n",

As a virulent pandemic ravaged the globe, the United States has dealt with racial unrest, an imperiled democratic system and some of the warmest weather in recorded history. During this time, a shared dedication to mitigating our world’s generational ills and inequities was born.

            "Yet, the fashion industry, among others, faces a worrying future as it struggles to catch up with a maturing nation. Fashion depends on its powers of seduction; it entices consumers to want, to need and to spend. The endless cycles of trends, promotions and merchandise turnover make sustainability a seemingly impossible consideration. If industry leaders are unwilling to prioritize sustainability, it is the responsibility of consumers to discover and support fashion’s eco-friendly faction.\n",
            "\n",
            "New options beckon. In recent advertising, a small, resolute segment of the fashion industry attempts to take responsibility. In a full broadsheet advertisement in The New York Times, Allbirds, a company known for wool footwear, published a screenshot of an imaginary email addressed to many of fashion’s most popular brands, such as Adidas, Ralph Lauren and Zara. Referring to its pollution as “a dirty little secret,” Allbirds does what too many fashion companies have failed to do. The company begins with an admission of guilt and makes no attempt to conceal its contribution to the climate crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "In subsequent paragraphs, the New Zealand-American company announces the release of its Carbon Footprint and emissions calculations. Allbirds avers, “We know sharing proprietary information might not make the most business sense. But the global climate crisis is bigger than business.” The footwear company does not just attempt to make corporate responsibility trendy, it recognizes the irresponsibility of its industry counterparts and asks them to resist considerations of personal advantage. Before signing off, Allbirds encourages companies to use its calculation tool to help improve their own carbon footprint. Responses pending, for now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Allbirds is not alone in its expressed commitment to sustainability. Although Industry of All Nations, a California-based apparel company, is perhaps best-known for its organic cotton T-shirts and undyed alpaca knitwear, it is much more than a fashion label. Industry of All Nations is a part of a burgeoning subset of companies who research, discover and develop new methods of producing clothing ethically and sustainably. Positioning its commitment to sustainability center stage, the company uses its website to tell the story of each garment. An Industry of All Nations’ tee is produced according to the standards upheld by a network of Indian cotton farmers, spinners, loomers and tailors whose techniques are rooted in community and ancestry.\n",
            "\n",
            "During a time when consumers are increasingly free to navigate retail without humans, Industry of All Nations insists on humanizing every step of the shopping experience. The Abbot Kinney location is an ebullient space bathed in the Southern Californian sun where shoppers admire displays of raw pigments and read about the company’s story and objectives. Seeing the store in action, it is clear that the brand has solved the sustainability puzzle by offering an attractive shopping experience without surrendering to the temptations of global production chains. Armed with the right information, consumers can find similarly sustainable brands wherever their tastes take them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite small companies’ efforts to reform the fashion industry, conglomerates dominate a market vitiated by profligacy. Common Objective, a business network dedicated to addressing fashion’s contribution to the climate crisis, reports that the average American consumer purchases one mid-priced item of clothing per week. Fast fashion’s vicious business model keeps consumers in their thrall. To keep up with the incessant cycling and recycling of trends, Zara restocks its 1,700 stores biweekly and manufactures nearly half a billion items annually. Faced with the allure of abundance and inexpensiveness, consumers must consider their culpability in the global climate crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recognizing our individual role can induce fatigue of the imagination. There is an immense distance between understanding the climate crisis and feeling it. In 2021, the ugly consequences of corporate and consumer irresponsibility are harder to perceive than overlapping political, social and public health emergencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "To believe individual actions are essential to collective outcomes requires courage and commitment. But our actions do not need to be repressed by our conviction that they matter. A change of personal style or loyalty to a particular eco-friendly brand are not necessarily the right answers. Rather, finding the right answer requires a heightened awareness of the problem and a willingness to explore potential solutions. You may find that the answer already lies within your wardrobe. The most sustainable sweater is not necessarily the one that you buy from an emerging eco-friendly brand; it is the one you love that you wear over and over.\n",

            "For those in the earth science community, there was a far more pressing question to be answered. Just a few weeks earlier, on the day after Thanksgiving, the Trump administration had released—dumped, really—a landmark, 1,500-page federal review of the risks of global warming, the Fourth National Climate Assessment. Two of Reilly’s top scientists had helped to oversee the project, which drew heavily on research done at USGS and other federal agencies. But the White House had gone out of its way to discredit the report: “It’s not based on facts,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters a few days after its lackadaisical release. “It’s based on modeling, which is extremely hard to do when you’re talking about the climate.” As the new director of the agency, Reilly hadn’t made any public statement on the matter, and it wasn’t clear exactly where he stood.\n",
            "\n",
            "Forty-five minutes later, as Reilly finished up his conference presentation, that mystery remained. “The most important thing about flying in space is changing your perspective,” he told the audience of scientists. A final slide went up: Earth, as seen from orbit. “All those things that you and I see as differences here on the ground disappear in space,” he said. “You don’t see some of the differences that you might see politically in space. It’s really all about the planet, and that’s what we do at USGS.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It was not until the Q&A that AGU’s then president, Eric Davidson, gently put the new director on the spot: “I think many of us found it a little—maybe more than a little—discouraging,” he said, referring to Huckabee Sanders’ attack on climate modeling. “So what’s your advice to your scientists, to the rest of us in AGU who are working on providing datastreams to help constrain models, about trying to communicate that basis for the science of climate change?”\n",
            "\n",
            "Behind the scenes, that very issue—how to constrain models, and then communicate them—had already inspired one of Reilly’s most ambitious and divisive efforts at the agency. At its heart was a plan to reorient USGS research away from long-term thinking, to shrink its perspective. The idea, laid out in a memo Reilly drafted for Ryan Zinke, then the secretary of the interior, in December 2018 and obtained by WIRED, would be to develop department-wide “climate change decision-making” guidelines that focused only on the next 10 years, so predictions could be made—and acted upon—with maximal confidence. That meant the policy process would disregard the distant future, where climate impacts could be cataclysmic.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reilly had hinted at this plan during his conference presentation, showing what he called the “spaghetti chart” of climate model pathways, extending from 1950 to 2100. In the middle of the chart, from the present day up until around 2040, the spaghetti strands are sheathed together—the models well-aligned because, over the next few decades, the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are already accounted for; and the other, most important variables, such as El Niño weather patterns, are beyond the control of humans. But off to the right, the same strands splay out like noodles plopped into a pasta pot: a bath of boiling unknowns, a tangle of \"emissions scenarios\" that follow from whatever choices we make in years to come. Reilly warned the audience that it’s risky to set policy based on these far-out reaches of the modeled climate curve—there’s far too much uncertainty. So instead, he said, he’d like the agency to take a narrower view: “What’s gonna happen over the next 20, 30, 40 years? How far out can we push that and still stay within a statistically relevant trajectory?”\n",
            "\n",
            "For many in the audience, this must have sounded obtuse. In fact, these furthest reaches of the climate pathways—the tips of the spaghetti—are the very ones that matter most for policy, says Richard Alley, a geoscientist at Penn State and the former chair of the National Research Council’s panel on abrupt climate change, who was also at the conference. By the time you get to the end of the century the greatest source of uncertainty derives from what we as a society do—or fail to do. The imprecision represents an opportunity, then: a chance to navigate a safer, flatter curve into the future. Put another way, by focusing exclusively on climate projections for the next few decades, where there isn’t much to argue over, Reilly’s plan enforces helplessness. “The shorter the window you worry about, the less you do to reduce emissions,” Alley says.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the conference ballroom, Ericson tried to press Reilly on this topic, as it related to the comments from the White House. “Of course there’s a left and a right to these issues,” Reilly answered. “It’s all politics—and my position on the science is that science has no politics.” Reilly would come back to that favorite phrase again a moment later: Science has no politics.\n",
            "\n",
            "By this point in the session, though, it was easy to imagine that the new director might really mean the opposite. Within the federal government, the USGS has long been a bastion of independent-minded research—“policy neutral but policy relevant,” its staffers like to say—with a grand and vital mission to describe and understand the Earth. Almost one-third of the agency’s first 47 employees, upon its founding in 1879, were members of the National Academy of Sciences. But now, it seemed naive to wonder whether science has any politics. A different proposition was on the table: Under Reilly’s leadership, and in this Administration, would politics allow for that much science?\n",
            "\n",
            "Geology, as a discipline, often involves the study of “deep time”: the profound magnitudes of history, a billion-year continuum on which continents drift and break apart, and the climate sways from ice to fire and back again. But the work at USGS can also come down to crucial moments, not so much gee-whiz as oh-shit: A seismic wave from far away hits a laboratory instrument, signaling the onset of an earthquake, and there’s a narrow interval in which to issue an alert. “You might have 20 seconds or 120 seconds, it isn’t much for you and I,” Reilly told the audience at AGU. But for a gas utility, this could be the margin needed to shut things down and prevent a series of explosions. The same is true for tornado warnings, flood alerts: Every minute, every second, counts.\n",
            "\n",
            "That’s where Reilly seems most comfortable—in the zone of near and consequential outcomes, measured and assessed with extreme precision. As a logistical engineer at NASA, he’d been responsible for multi-staged tasks that require months of planning and for which the margin of error could be razor thin. “You get one shot to get it right, and if you don’t get it, you’re stuck,” says Danny Olivas, who was Reilly’s partner for his eight-hour spacewalk in 2007. More serious mistakes, of course, could be fatal. On his first mission in 1998, Reilly was in charge of choreographing the transfer of thousands of pounds of supplies and equipment to the Mir space station. “He did that just masterfully,” says Terry Wilcutt, the flight’s commander. “He can take a complex task and break it down into executable pieces and then it just goes smoothly.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But what USGS scientists do is in a sense the opposite of logistical engineering: Much of the agency’s research is based on stitching together a diverse array of data and observations, both in the lab and in the field, in order to better understand the planet. That’s true whether scientists are estimating petroleum reserves in the Permian Basin or the rate at which glaciers are melting in Montana. Doubt is often pervasive, and USGS scientists must think very carefully about how to address it. “You have to be comfortable with the uncertainty, or at least not paralyzed by it,” says one former scientist at USGS.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reilly’s arrival at the agency brought a clash of cultures, then, between the spacemen and the modelers. “He really cannot grasp that dealing with climate science is not an engineering problem,” says the scientist, who has worked closely with Reilly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reilly, who is in his early sixties, holds a PhD in geosciences, but he’s had no previous management experience in federal government nor was he a very active member of the research community. Indeed, before he was appointed by President Trump, few at the agency had even heard of him, according to interviews with USGS employees. Following his stint at NASA, he served as dean of the school of science and technology at a for-profit, online university and started a consulting firm; all while leaving little public record of his political leanings or personal beliefs. At the time of his US Senate confirmation hearings, one headline stated, “Nominee to lead USGS is hard to read.” Reilly even cracked a joke about his atypical career path at the Geological Society meeting, speaking as the first astronaut ever to lead the agency. “How did I get either of those jobs?” he asked. “I have no clue and I’m not asking.”\n",
            "\n",
            "In fact, Reilly’s name had been floated as a possible candidate by his good friend Harrison “Jack” Schmitt, another former astronaut who happened to have contacts in the Trump administration. In addition to flying on the final Apollo mission, Schmitt has made a name for himself as an outspoken critic of climate science. In 2018, during a panel discussion, Schmitt was asked about his doubt that human beings are causing climate change. “There is no evidence,” he said. “There are models. But models of very, very complex natural systems are often wrong.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Model-bashing has been a favorite pastime among those who deny that humans are the primary drivers of climate change. This makes perfect sense, since it’s the models that dictate action: They show what might happen if we continue down our current path and hint at how we might avoid it. If the models can’t be trusted, or if their scope is limited, then the future is unknowable; and if the future is unknowable, then what’s the case for regulation? That’s why the most heavily polluting industries have been incentivized to focus on climate models’ flaws, in much the way that commercial interests have tried to shower doubt on research into the long-term health effects of asbestos, smog, and cigarettes (among many other things).\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, a network of conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation and the Heartland Institute, have consistently pushed the notion that climate models are defective, which has in turn become a central talking point at the White House. In 2018, the Heritage Foundation told The New York Times Magazine that 66 of its employees and alumni had joined the federal government. Schmitt happens to be a former board member and policy adviser at the Heartland Institute. William Happer, a professor emeritus at Princeton who has compared climate models to Enron’s accounting practices—and described those who believe in them as members of a “cult”—also has close ties to Heartland, and was, until recently, a top Trump adviser.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reilly’s own efforts to constrain the use of models have been insistent, and his steadfast aversion to the long view seems also to apply to USGS itself. Several government employees I interviewed for this story said they’d gotten the sense that Reilly views climate models as the mishandled tools of a broken, antiquated institution—and one that’s filled with broken, antiquated researchers. More than a dozen current and former employees told me that his tenure at the agency has been both morale-crushing and hostile, especially for the agency’s longest-serving scientists. These claims may be addressed in a report focused on Reilly from the Inspector General’s office at the Department of the Interior that is set to be released later this month. According to multiple sources who served as witnesses for the IG, Reilly has effectively purged the agency of senior-level employees who had been close to his predecessor; while elevating a former NASA employee to serve as his deputy director, and intervening to install a former astronaut and friend, C.J. Loria, as director of the Earth Resources and Observation Science Center. “There are people in the survey whose careers he has destroyed,” says one senior USGS employee interviewed by the IG’s office.\n",
            "\n",
            "A separate report, related to an age-discrimination case, has already been completed by the department’s Office of Civil Rights. In 2019, a 63-year-old woman who had worked for the federal government since the early 1980s complained that Reilly had ordered her duties stripped the year before, because he knew she planned to retire and wanted to “speed it up and make it happen.” Reilly denied the allegation, but the Office found in the employee’s favor at the end of August and said USGS must take corrective action and provide documentation of whatever disciplinary measures are adopted. (In response to requests for comment about the Office of Civil Rights report and the IG report, a USGS spokesperson provided the following statement: “Independent, unbiased science is foundational to the USGS and critical to the 21st Century global challenges we face. Dr. Reilly has endeavored to uphold scientific principles by strengthening operational standards, challenging norms, encouraging internal debate and pushing the organization to greater heights to meet those challenges.\")\n",
            "\n",
            "Several witnesses in the age-discrimination case told investigators they’d heard Reilly grouse about all the “gray-haired” people at the agency, and imply that younger people should be hired in their place. The director had even said as much in public. A few days before Reilly spoke at the AGU meeting, he’d been asked to sign a stack of 40-year certificates, honoring his veteran employees. “The good news is, people love their jobs, they come to work and they are still there,” he told the audience during his conference presentation, in reference to that paperwork. “The bad news is, they’re still there. No, I’m kidding!”\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, about 20 scientists from the upper echelons of USGS had convened with Reilly on the sidelines of the conference. Many were meeting the director for the first time. But he seemed less interested in honoring their years of service than lamenting the absence of younger scientists, according to a person who was present. That person recalls that Reilly looked around the room, and noted that the agency is just too old. (Reilly declined to comment on this episode.)\n",
            "\n",
            "“This was the moment, when he’s sitting there with the senior scientists … and telling us we were redundant and useless. That’s when I realized we were really screwed,” the attendee says. “That was my light bulb.”\n",
            "\n",
            "A government spokesman later clarified, “Currently, there are no specific efforts [of this kind] underway at EPA.” As for specific efforts of this kind in other parts of government, the spokesman didn’t say.\n",
            "\n",
            "In fact, the language from the summit closely mirrored Reilly’s thoughts on what to do at USGS. Hints of his proposal would come to light a few weeks later, when the New York Times published a front-page story saying that Reilly had ordered his agency to narrow its horizon for climate projections to 2040. In an all-employee email sent the next morning, and obtained by WIRED, Reilly disputed that account: “As you should know there has been no such directive given,” he wrote. The agency had embarked upon an effort to “develop and refine” how the Department of the Interior uses climate models for decision-making, the email said, and related guidelines would be issued soon. “In the meantime, keep doing the great work we do in the Survey and remember: science has no politics.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But new reporting from WIRED and Type Investigations—including conversations with more than 20 current and former government employees, and a review of several hundred pages of internal documents—reveals a more extensive effort to reframe the way that USGS scientists use modeling in their research. It’s true there was (and is) no hard cutoff for projections: Reilly’s draft directive on the subject, circulated among senior staff this past July and obtained by WIRED, suggests that projections run to 2045, “as an initial assessment range.” Still, Reilly has made it very clear that he wants to keep the focus on that narrow frame whenever possible; and in pursuit of this agenda, he has overlooked the guidance of his staff scientists in favor of a highly-unusual relationship with an outside contractor.\n",
            "\n",
            "The push appears to have begun soon after he was confirmed. According to emails obtained through a FOIA request, that’s when Reilly began laying the framework for a partnership with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a nonprofit consortium of colleges and universities that manages the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The center is one of several institutions that develop models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other climate researchers. Reilly paid a visit to its Colorado campus during his second week on the job. By the end of 2018, USGS was in discussions with the consortium about a possible contract to review climate models.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the details were being worked out, Reilly sought advice from the consortium on the internal policy memo that he’d prepared for Zinke, which floated his proposal for new, department-wide guidelines on the use of climate modeling. Every five years a team of USGS and NCAR scientists would evaluate the latest data to revise those models, the memo said. The idea would be to provide DOI with the tools needed to respond to climate change “within a statistically manageable range of possibilities”—i.e. on a 10-to-20-year horizon.\n",
            "\n",
            "Scott Rayder, a former chief of staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who was then a senior adviser at the consortium, responded with his feedback. “This looks stellar,” he told Reilly. “I think this is a huge step forward.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Three months later, on March 19, NCAR was awarded a non-competitive $40 million contract to advise USGS on a wide range of issues including “models, observations, computational resources, data services, and education and outreach.” Though the language in the contract is expansive—in theory it could encompass just about any USGS initiative—Reilly would, in private emails, clarify his interest. In a message dated May 7, he asked Rayder to confirm the scope of work: “Will this agreement cover and operate in a way to support our 60-month review of climate change models?” Rayder responded that he thought it would. (In a written statement, the consortium said Reilly’s memo was “consistent with the briefings he received from NCAR scientists.”)\n",
            "\n",
            "According to multiple USGS sources Reilly’s handling of the memo violated agency norms. “It may have run afoul of regulations prohibiting the sharing of non-public information,” says Debra Sonderman, who was the procurement executive at DOI for nearly three decades before she retired in 2017. Policy memos, which USGS rarely drafts, are not typically shown to outside entities particularly during the early stages of their development. Members of the private sector are not supposed to be involved in their production, says Sonderman.\n",
            "\n",
            "The size of the contract is also noteworthy: According to federal contracting data going back to 2008, USGS has only worked with the consortium in charge of NCAR on a few occasions and for far smaller sums. Its largest contract with the consortium was a one-year, $60,000 research and development project in 2009. USGS said all federal regulations were followed in pursuing the non-competitive award.\n",
            "\n",
            "A consortium spokesperson said the group’s researchers frequently provide guidance to federal agencies on a variety of climate-related issues. But the spokesperson added, “We do not necessarily know how our comments will ultimately be used, and whether a particular memo … is for internal policy or another purpose.”\n",
            "\n",
            "In a written statement to WIRED, Reilly echoed what he’d written in his all-staff email, that he has not issued “any directive that restricts the development or use of climate models by USGS researchers or limits projections of climate impacts past 2040.” He also said, “USGS will continue to use all accepted models and scenarios” and to “assess the entire range of reference scenarios from best-case to worst case in its scientific studies.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Yet when Reilly assembled a team of his own top climate researchers to draft a white paper on modeling in 2019, not long after the Times story was published, some within the agency understood it as a means of building scientific cover for a plan to narrow the time horizon. “We were all very much painfully aware of the 2040 thing,” says one of the scientists tapped for that assignment.\n",
            "\n",
            "The white-paper team had frequent phone calls with Reilly as he tried to guide the process, and tried to explain the rationale for making long-term projections. Reilly wasn’t interested. “He didn’t want to understand it,” says the scientist who was on the team. “He wanted to justify his position.” During one exchange, Reilly asked the scientists to cut a relatively benign sentence that read: “To fulfill their missions successfully, natural resource managers often must consider future risks including those stemming from climate change.” In another, according to the scientist, Reilly raised questions about a graph showing a set of IPCC models and what might happen under different emissions scenarios—a version of the “Spaghetti Chart.” Reilly went into his spaceman spiel: He said there were so many variables going into these scenarios, the scientist recalls, that it would be impossible even to make a statement about them, let alone a policy decision. (USGS said that the agency’s fundamental scientific practices were followed during the development of the paper.)\n",
            "\n",
            "This represented a fundamental misunderstanding of what these models are designed to do, according to that scientist. It’s not about making firm predictions of what will happen in the year 2100—of course you can’t do that. It’s about preparing yourself for the full range of potential outcomes, and understanding how they might depend on decisions that we make today. “You very clearly can say something,” the scientist explains. “You can say we are going to be significantly worse off if we don’t do something.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The white paper, titled “Using Information from Global Climate Models to Inform Policy Making—The Role of the USGS,” was quietly published in June. Reilly’s meddling appears to have been shrugged off. The paper highlights the utility of modeled scenarios that project 100 years or more into the future. “Examining a range of projected climate outcomes,” it says, “is a recommended best practice.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Some members of the advisory board for the US Global Change Research Program, which coordinates and oversees the National Climate Assessments, worried that the proposed changes would make the document much less useful and accessible for non-scientists. According to one member, the board felt that the changes pushed by Levenbach might also end up misleading readers on important points, such as the degree to which the assessment actually focuses on climate projections.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It created some tense moments,” another board member told me. At that point, the program’s acting chair was Virginia Burkett, a USGS veteran of more than 30 years. Burkett is an internationally recognized climate scientist—she was part of the team that won the Nobel Prize for the IPCC report in 2007—and has always tried to keep her distance from political entanglements. “As a scientist,” she said in a 2014 interview, “I think you lose credibility if you become a table-banging activist.” But when the last-minute request for edits came in from NOAA, Burkett stood firm. “Virginia, as the chair at the time, you know pushed back pretty hard,” the board member said.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the end, Burkett’s faction held the line and none of the requested changes were put into the report. But according to the senior USGS employee, Reilly was deeply dissatisfied with the process and the way Burkett handled it. (Burkett declined to comment for this story.) In 2019, he told Burkett that he would be replacing her as program chair. Her successor turned out to be Wayne Higgins, a NOAA climate scientist who had been involved in negotiating the requested changes on behalf of Levenbach. “She paid a big price for sticking her neck out,” said a former government scientist who was intimately involved in the Fourth Assessment. USGS said Burkett was replaced because it was time for another member agency to chair the research program.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite these machinations, and however much the Trump administration tried to spin the Fourth Assessment, they arrived too late to make a difference. Much of the work on that report had already been completed by the time Trump took office; and so—just like the climate curves on Reilly’s “Spaghetti Chart”—the short-term outcome was never really in question. It’s only by looking forward that one can spot the bigger dangers: The Fifth National Climate Assessment is due out in 2023, and if Trump is reelected, his Administration will get to shape what is arguably the most important policy document on climate change produced by the federal government. In the meantime, Reilly’s plan to re-examine—and perhaps restrict—the use of climate models will have had a chance to gestate further. And all along the way, the hottest-ever years on record will continue to accumulate. This past May, in the midst of the pandemic, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surpassed 417 parts per million. It was the first time this has happened in at least three million years.\n",
            "\n",
            "If Trump loses, though, then Reilly will almost certainly be out; and there’s no way to know for sure how the next administration—and the next USGS director—might approach these problems. That’s what happens when you’re doing geoscience on a political timescale: The future only lasts until the next election.\n",

            "\n",
            "In an effort to “significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change,” the accord calls for limiting the global average temperature rise in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. It also asks countries to work to achieve a leveling off of global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to become greenhouse gas emissions neutral in the second half of this century. In 2018, the IPCC’s Special Report: Global Warming at 1.5 Degrees Celsius concluded the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsuis could mean substantially more poverty, extreme heat, sea level rise, habitat loss, and drought.\n",
            "\n",
            "To achieve the Paris Agreement’s original objectives, 186 countries—responsible for more than 90 percent of global emissions—submitted carbon reduction targets, known as “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDCs), prior to the Paris conference. These targets outlined each country’s commitments for curbing emissions (including through the preservation of carbon sinks) through 2025 or 2030, including economy-wide carbon-cutting goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "INDCs turn into NDCs—nationally determined contributions—once a country formally joins the agreement. There are no specific requirements about how or how much countries should cut emissions, but there have been political expectations about the type and stringency of targets by various countries based on the latest science. As a result, national plans vary greatly in scope and ambition, largely reflecting each country’s capabilities, its level of development, and its contribution to emissions over time. China, for example, committed to leveling off its carbon emissions no later than 2030. India set its sights on cutting emissions intensity by 33 to 35 percent below 2005 levels and generating 40 percent of its electricity from non–fossil fuel sources by 2030.\n",
            "\n",
            "The United States—the world’s largest historical emitter and the second-biggest current emitter after China—had committed to cutting overall greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. U.S. initiatives to achieve the target include the Clean Power Plan (a state-by-state program to cut carbon pollution from the power sector) and the tightening of automotive fuel economy standards to reduce transportation emissions—both policies the Trump administration fought hard to roll back and which the Biden/Harris administration has committed to strengthening.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Paris Agreement includes a series of mandatory measures for the monitoring, verification, and public reporting of progress toward a country’s emissions-reduction targets. The enhanced transparency rules apply common frameworks for all countries, with accommodations and support provided for nations that currently lack the capacity to strengthen their systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among other requirements, countries must report their greenhouse gas inventories and progress relative to their targets, allowing outside experts to evaluate their success. Countries are also expected to revisit their pledges and put forward progressively stronger targets every five years, with the goal of further driving down emissions. Nations must participate in a “global stocktake” to measure collective efforts toward meeting the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals as well. Meanwhile, developed countries also have to estimate how much financial assistance they’ll allocate to developing nations to help them reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "These transparency and accountability provisions are similar to those in the frameworks of other international agreements. While the system doesn’t include financial penalties, the requirements are aimed at making the progress of individual nations easy to track and fostering a sense of global peer pressure, discouraging any dragging of feet among countries that may consider doing so.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recognizing that many developing countries and small island nations that have contributed the least to climate change could suffer the most from its consequences, the Paris Agreement includes a plan for developed countries—and others “in a position to do so”—to continue to provide financial resources to help developing countries mitigate and increase resilience to climate change. For instance, India’s pledge includes the need to eradicate poverty in parallel with decreasing emissions and increasing renewable energy, such as addressing energy poverty and access in remote villages that rely on diesel generators. With technological and financial help from wealthier countries, important equity-focused goals such as these can be within reach. The Paris Agreement builds on the financial commitments of the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, which aimed to scale up public and private climate finance for developing nations to $100 billion a year by 2020. The Copenhagen pact also created the Green Climate Fund to help mobilize transformational private finance using targeted public dollars. The Paris Agreement established the expectation that the world would set a higher annual goal by 2025 to build on the $100 billion target for 2020 and would put mechanisms in place to achieve that scaling up. Unfortunately, collective contributions continue to fall short, reaching approximately $79 billion in 2019.\n",
            "\n",
            "While developed nations are not legally bound to contribute a specific amount to the mitigation and adaptation efforts of developing countries, they are encouraged to provide financial support and are required to report on the financing they supply or will mobilize.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rarely is there consensus among nearly all nations on a single topic. But with the Paris Agreement, leaders from around the world collectively agreed that climate change is driven by human behavior, that it’s a threat to the environment and all of humanity, and that global action is needed to stop it. It also created a clear framework for all countries to make emissions reduction commitments and strengthen those actions over time. Here are some key reasons why the agreement is so important:\n",
            "\n",
            "Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane are gases that collect in the atmosphere and prevent heat from radiating from earth’s surface into space, creating what’s known as the greenhouse effect. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading international scientific body studying the subject, the concentration of these heat-trapping gases has increased substantially since preindustrial times to levels not seen in at least 800,000 years. Carbon dioxide (the chief contributor to climate change) is up by 40 percent, nitrous oxide by 20 percent, and methane by a whopping 150 percent since 1750—mainly from the burning of dirty fossil fuels. The IPCC says it’s “extremely likely” that these emissions are mostly to blame for the rise in global temperatures since the 1950s. Meanwhile, deforestation and forest degradation have contributed significantly to global carbon emissions as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hotter temperatures—both on land and at sea—alter global weather patterns and change how and where precipitation falls. Those shifting patterns exacerbate dangerous and deadly drought, heat waves, floods, wildfires, and storms, including hurricanes. They also melt ice caps, glaciers, and layers of permafrost, which can lead to rising sea levels and coastal erosion. Warmer temperatures impact whole ecosystems as well, throwing migration patterns and life cycles out of whack. For example, an early spring can induce trees and plants to flower before bees and other pollinators have emerged. While global warming may equate to longer growing seasons and higher food production in some regions, areas already coping with water scarcity are expected to become drier, creating the potential for drought, failed crops, or wildfires.\n",
            "\n",
            "As climate change fuels temperature increases and extreme weather events, it jeopardizes our air, water, and food; spreads disease; and imperils our homes and safety. We are confronting a growing public health crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "The countries hardest hit by the impact of climate change will be low-lying nations uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise and developing countries that lack the resources to adapt to temperature and precipitation changes. But wealthy nations such as the United States are increasingly vulnerable as well. Indeed, many millions of Americans—particularly children, the elderly, and the impoverished—are already suffering climate change’s wrath. Many frontline communities are majority people of color. Around the world, those most impacted by climate change are those who contribute least to emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The IPCC notes that climate change will be limited only by “substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.” While one can debate the merits of using a single global temperature threshold to represent dangerous climate change, the general scientific view today—represented in the IPCC’s Special Report: Global Warming at 1.5 Degrees Celsius—is that any rise in global temperatures of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius would be an unacceptably high risk, potentially resulting in major extinctions, more severe droughts and hurricanes, a watery Arctic, and an increased toll on human health and well-being. Furthermore, as the IPCC has noted, while it remains uncertain precisely how much global warming will “trigger abrupt and irreversible changes” in the earth’s systems, the risk of crossing the threshold only increases as temperatures rise.\n",
            "\n",
            "To avoid major changes to life as we know it, global action must be taken. At the Paris climate conference, all countries committed to a target of keeping the temperature change to well below 2 degrees and to make efforts to prevent a change greater than 1.5 degrees. Unfortunately, the emissions gap—the emissions level with existing commitments compared to a safer trajectory—is still dangerously large as of 2020. Every tenth of a degree matters, and we cannot prevent this unless we act immediately to cut emissions deeply.\n",
            "\n",
            "There’s a lot of misinformation out there about the Paris Agreement, including the idea that it will hurt the U.S. economy. That was among a number of unfounded claimsformer president Trump repeated, arguing that the accord would cost the U.S. economy $3 trillion by 2040 and $2.7 million jobs by 2025, making us less competitive against China and India. But as fact checkers noted, these statistics originated from a debunked March 2017 study that exaggerated the future costs of emissions reductions, underestimated advances in energy efficiency and clean energy technologies, and outright ignored the huge health and economic costs of climate change itself. Climate change is already costing public health. Research from NRDC scientists shows how inaction on climate change is responsible for many billions in health costs each year in just the United States—as communities around the world experience greater displacement, illness, famine, water shortages, civil strife, and death.\n",
            "\n",
            "Research makes clear that the cost of climate inaction far outweighs the cost of reducing carbon pollution. One 2018 study suggests that if the United States failed to meet its Paris climate goals, it could cost the economy as much as $6 trillion in the coming decades. A worldwide failure to meet the NDCs currently laid out in the agreement could reduce global GDP more than 25 percent by century’s end. Meanwhile, another study estimates that meeting—or even exceeding—the Paris goals via infrastructure investments in both clean energy and energy efficiency could have major global rewards—to the tune of some $19 trillion.\n",
            "\n",
            "In terms of employment, the clean energy sector employed more than 3 million Americans before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic—about 14 times the number of coal, gas, oil, and other fossil fuel industry workers—and has the potential to employ many more with further investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electric grid modernization to replace the aging coal-powered infrastructure. Meanwhile, coal jobs aren’t so much being transferred “out of America” as they are falling victim to market forces as renewable and natural gas prices decline. But supporting policies that promote an equitable transition—with community-led decision-making, a focus on equity, and retraining support—is an important means to helping communities leave the dirty energy economy behind them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, rather than giving China and India a pass to pollute, as Trump claimed, the pact represents the first time those two major developing economies have agreed to concrete and time-bound climate commitments. Both countries, which are already poised to lead the world in renewable energy, have made significant progress to meet their Paris goals.\n",

            "In 1992, President George H.W. Bush joined 107 other heads of state at the Rio Earth Summit in Brazil to adopt a series of environmental agreements, including the UNFCCC framework that remains in effect today. The international treaty aimed to prevent dangerous human interference with earth’s climate systems over the long term. The pact set no limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contained no enforcement mechanisms, but instead established a framework for international negotiations of future agreements, or protocols, to set binding emissions targets. Participating countries meet annually at a Conference of the Parties (COP) to assess their progress and continue talks on how to best tackle climate change.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Kyoto Protocol, a landmark environmental treaty that was adopted in 1997 at the COP 3 in Japan, represents the first time nations agreed to legally mandated, country-specific emissions reduction targets. The protocol, which didn’t go into effect until 2005, set binding emissions reduction targets for developed countries only, on the premise that they were responsible for most of the earth’s high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The United States initially signed the agreement but never ratified it; President George W. Bush argued that the deal would hurt the U.S. economy since developing nations such as China and India were not included. Without the participation of those three countries, the treaty’s effectiveness proved limited, with its targets covering only a small fraction of total global emissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Kyoto Protocol’s initial commitment period extended through 2012. That year, at the COP 18 in Doha, Qatar, delegates agreed to extend the accord until 2020 (without some developed nations, which had dropped out). They also reaffirmed their 2011 pledge from the COP 17 in Durban, South Africa, to create a new, comprehensive climate treaty by 2015 that would require all big emitters not included in the Kyoto Protocol—such as China, India, and the United States—to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The new treaty—what would become the Paris Agreement—was to fully replace the Kyoto Protocol by 2020. However, the Paris accord went into effect earlier than expected, in November 2016.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which established top-down legally binding emissions reduction targets (as well as penalties for noncompliance) for developed nations only, the Paris Agreement requires that all countries—rich, poor, developed, and developing—do their part and slash greenhouse gas emissions. To that end, greater flexibility and national ownership is built into the Paris Agreement: No language is included about the commitments countries should make; nations can set their own emissions targets (NDCs) consistent with their level of development and technological advancement.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the Paris Agreement doesn’t have harsh penalties for countries not meeting their targets, it does have a robust system of monitoring, reporting, and reassessing individual and collective country targets over time in order to move the world closer to the broader objectives of the deal. And the agreement sets forth a requirement for countries to announce their next round of targets every five years—unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed for that objective but didn’t include a specific requirement to achieve it.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the Paris Agreement ultimately aims to cap global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius in this century, many studies evaluating the national pledges countries made in Paris show that the cumulative effect of those emissions reductions won’t be large enough to keep temperatures under that limit. Indeed, the targets that countries laid out are expected to limit future temperature rise to approximately 2.9 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, despite temporary emissions drops related to changes in production and travel associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, current evaluations of how countries are performing in the context of their Paris climate goals indicate some nations are already falling short of their commitments.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, it’s important to remember the Paris Agreement isn’t static. Instead, it’s designed to boost countries’ national efforts over time—meaning that current commitments represent the floor, not the ceiling, of climate change ambition. The heavy lifting—reining in emissions even further by 2030 and 2050—still needs to be done, and the accord provides the tools and pressure to make that happen.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the Paris Agreement matures, nations including the United States must firmly commit to phasing out fossil fuel investment (locally and abroad) and investing in nature-based solutions. Often, the communities who contribute least to global emissions are the ones already showing wealthier nations the way, committing to rapid emissions reductions, renewable energy expansion, protecting their forests, and putting economies on low-carbon pathways. Nations must uplift these communities as well as those who are faced with the brunt of climate impacts. This includes formally protecting Indigenous knowledge and rights, which are critical to fighting the climate crisis. Indigenous peoples—comprising 5 percent of the global population—protect 80 percent of the planet’s biodiversity. Even without stronger recognition within the Paris Agreement, Indigenous and frontline communities are building a global movement and successfully fighting back against extractive, climate-damaging industries, including fossil-fuel pipelines, logging, dams, and mining.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reflecting the collective belief of nearly every nation on earth that climate change is humanity’s race to win, the Paris Agreement exposes America’s climate skeptics as global outliers. In fact, the mobilization of support for climate action across the country and around the world provides hope that the Paris Agreement marked a turning point in the global race against climate change. We can all contribute to the cause by seeking opportunities to slash global warming contributions—at the individual, local, and national levels—but we understand better than ever that individual action is not enough. There is a lot of damage from the Trump administration that President Biden will need to undo—and quickly. But the effort will be well worth the reward of a safer, cleaner world for future generations.\n",

The aims of COP 26 will be to assess the progress made under the Paris Agreement and to encourage countries to enhance their original NDCs into greater alignment with current climate science. While COP 26 was postponed due to COVID-19, the delay gives countries time to develop more ambitious targets and accelerate low-carbon actions to ensure a green and resilient recovery from COVID-19.\n",

            "Over the coming months the U.S. allies and rivals will closely watch to see by how much the administration offers to cut its emissions in the coming decade. A firm number is expected to be announced before the U.N. climate summit taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.\n",

Whatever you think of his politics that is one point he was absolutely right about. There's no way to make an ecologically sustainable society coexist with a consumer economy built on ever expanding production and consumption of resources. The only way to really fight climate change is scale back the way we live to levels that would appear like unadulterated poverty to most people in the developed west.\n",

We could have avoided this (I say \"could\" because it's already way too late to avoid what 10 years ago people were saying was the worst case scenario). We didn't because our leaders are more concerned with keeping capitalism alive then making the changes we need. And I don't see that changing without some sort of massive political upheaval.\n",

            "Here, I examine the relationship between strategy and sincerity and its implications for political activism, developing a third position which I term sincerity as strategy. Sincerity as strategy refers to the purposeful employment of sincerity to advance interests in the public sphere. To do so, I draw on Habermas’ suggestion that movements may act with a ‘dual orientation’, combining strategy (goal advancement) and sincerity (the promotion of mutual understanding). By analytically separating these two orientations of action as two kinds of action, it becomes possible to distinguish between actions that are strategic; sincere; and employ sincerity as strategy. I argue that the last type of action often has stronger potential than actions that are only strategic, which are cynical or opportunist, or actions that are purely sincere, which are idealistic. In the long run, to advance political ideals, movements need to consider both dimensions, and act in ways that are strategically sound and sincere.\n",

            "The risk of politicization is that environmental concerns are forced into discursive structures that are unfavorable to authentic deliberation about complex issues, like ethical questions of justice and responsibility. If established political discourse sets the terms of debate on environmental issues, it becomes difficult to discuss, for example, whether environmental concerns may be prioritized over economic interests. Instrumental reasoning alone cannot help maintaining a rational public sphere where complex concerns can be discussed. While the example of ALBA does not suggest that movements should reject cooperation with actors in the political sphere, it does suggest that the instrumental orientation of the political sphere constrains the space for authentic deliberation.\n",

Despite its seeming refusal to countenance any infringement on its sovereignty of the sort that agreeing as part of a global process to cut its emissions would connote, China could decide to make substantial unilateral cuts (see Schreurs's chapter). Chinese policy for the moment remains dominated by the economic growth imperative, but some of those exasperated by the kind of stalemate so common in liberal democratic states think that Chinese style authoritarianism might be capable of more decisive action. However, actually implementing such decisions amid complex circumstances may prove beyond the capacity of authoritarianism,\n",

For political party identification, interviewers ask, “In politics, as of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent?” For those respondents who answer “Independent,” mention another party, or do not answer the question, interviewers ask a follow-up question, “As of today, do you lean more to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party?,” and only those who do not choose remain Independents. For Figures 2–7, “Republican” and “lean to Republican” responses and “Democrat” and “lean to Democratic” responses are combined, and in subsequent statistical analyses party is coded into Republican, Independent, and Democrat. It is typical to treat “leaners” in this fashion, as they have been found to be strong partisans. See J. R. Petrocik, “Measuring Party Supporters: Leaners are Not Independents,” Electoral Studies 28 (2009): 562–72, and Abramowitz and Webster, note 15. We do not show the responses for the remaining “Independents” as they typically number less than 100 each year, and their percentages fluctuate considerably due to the small numbers of cases.\n",

It has also weakened fuel economy standards, which will also raise emissions — against the wishes of much of the auto industry. It’s trying to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waiver, which allows California to set air quality standards that are more demanding than federal rules.

Young people across the world have followed her path, striking and marching to make clear to adults and decision-makers that this is a true emergency. “We are children saying, ‘Why should we care about our future when no one else is doing that? And why should we bother to learn facts when facts don’t matter in this society?’ When children say something like that, I think adults feel very bad,” Thunberg told TIME in April. In late August, she landed in the U.S. after a 15-day boat trip across the Atlantic, and she has plans for a months-long tour of the Americas—with a zero-carbon footprint. “This is an existential crisis that is going to affect our whole civilization, the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced,” she says. “I’m not planning to stop this movement, and I don’t think anyone else is either.” —Suyin Haynes\n",

National leaders cannot credibly promise particular emission levels in the short- to midterm. Emissions are determined by too many forces outside governmental control, including fossil-fuel prices, trade, and the pace of economic growth.

By requiring unanimous consent among 193 participating countries, the UNFCCC process effectively guarantees treaties that reflect the lowest bid of its least ambitious members. Yet there is no substantive reason to require the involvement of every single country. After all, the top dozen emitters (counting the European Union as a single emitter) account for 74 percent of global emissions from fossil fuels. To make the size of the negotiating table more tractable, Victor suggests a \"carbon club\" along the lines of the World Trade Organization. Members would \"bid in\" with policies geared to their own national circumstances and, crucially, add contingent offers predicated on action from other members. Within the club, those contingent offers and shared benefits would create a virtuous cycle. Meanwhile, the club would craft smart incentives to lure in new members. (The Clean Development Mechanism -- Kyoto's main way of offering \"carrots\" to developing countries for emission reductions -- has proved largely ineffectual.)\n",

            "Even if countries do begin moving forward, changes of the scale required are going to be more difficult, expensive, and protracted than most climate hawks believe, Victor warns. When economists model the costs of addressing climate change, they frequently assume market-based policies like a carbon tax that distribute costs in a fair and transparent way. But precisely because such policies are up-front about costs, they tend to be politically unpopular. \"The basic logic of good economic design is fungibility and transparency,\" Victor notes ruefully. \"The basic logic of politics encourages the hiding and channeling of costs and benefits.\" Politically powerful constituencies will organize to capture more than their share of benefits and avoid their share of the costs. That pushes politicians toward policies like direct regulation that impose higher net costs but hide those costs better and therefore elicit less blowback. \"Political forces strongly favor policy choices that are exactly reverse the advice of expert economists,\" Victor writes, thus the cost of tackling climate change is likely to be higher than economists project.\n",

In 2019, renewables accounted for nearly 15 percent of China’s energy mix, compared to 7 percent a decade earlier. China has used hydropower for years, and it is installing more solar panels and wind power generators as the world’s leading manufacturer of those technologies. It is also boosting its nuclear power capacity, with seventeen reactors under construction as of mid-2021. Moreover, Beijing and some provinces are incentivizing electric vehicle use; in 2019, more electric vehicles—25.8 million—were sold in China than in any other country. Still, experts point out that the vast majority of electricity for such vehicles is produced with fossil fuels.\n",

The longer we drag our feet, the less we stand to gain and the more we impoverish our future selves. The climate crisis is a test we are not guaranteed to pass. Can we change? Can we speak, relate, and think differently? Can we put aside our differences and resist the seductions of cynicism and moralism? Ironically, the instinct behind the tribalism that is tearing our political culture apart is the drive to band together to protect the group. What has been a political liability could become an asset in a fight that requires solidarity—if only we can channel it toward common threats and away from exaggerated symbolic divisions.\n",

Paralleling these challenges is an explosion of development that will rival post-World War II land use expansion.

The report, Oreskes said, was well-received by government officials at the time and proved prescient, predicting that if nothing was done, atmospheric carbon dioxide could rise 25 percent by 2000, a level at which climate effects would be visible.\n",

Humans are currently adding roughly 36 gigatons of CO2 annually to the atmosphere. To put these colossal numbers into perspective, let’s look at the effects of individual actions in terms of tons of CO2 saved per year. The four most CO2-saving actions for people living in the United States are to have one fewer child, live car-free, avoid airplane travel, and eat a plant-based diet. For example, a single person living car-free in the United States saves more than three tons of CO2 per year, and eating a plant-based diet saves a bit more than one ton. Every American currently emits roughly 18 tons of CO2 on average per year. In order to reach safe climate goals by 2050, the U.S. per capita emissions need to drop to less than 2.5 tons of CO2 per year.\n",

Project Drawdown takes a sum-total-of-small-gains approach as it outlines 100 solutions to our climate predicament. Hawken and his colleagues have made careful calculations for lowering CO2 emissions, one sector of human society at a time. For example, replacing, avoiding leaks of, and safely destroying chemical refrigerants found in all refrigerators, supermarket cases, and air conditioners add up to the number one societal level change that we can make to reduce greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons used for cooling have a capacity to warm the atmosphere at rates that are 9,000 times greater than CO2. Increasing onshore wind turbines to account for 22% of our total energy use is the number two most effective societal change toward lowering CO2 emissions.

            "Reilly had hinted at this plan during his conference presentation, showing what he called the “spaghetti chart” of climate model pathways, extending from 1950 to 2100. In the middle of the chart, from the present day up until around 2040, the spaghetti strands are sheathed together—the models well-aligned because, over the next few decades, the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are already accounted for; and the other, most important variables, such as El Niño weather patterns, are beyond the control of humans. But off to the right, the same strands splay out like noodles plopped into a pasta pot: a bath of boiling unknowns, a tangle of \"emissions scenarios\" that follow from whatever choices we make in years to come. Reilly warned the audience that it’s risky to set policy based on these far-out reaches of the modeled climate curve—there’s far too much uncertainty. So instead, he said, he’d like the agency to take a narrower view: “What’s gonna happen over the next 20, 30, 40 years? How far out can we push that and still stay within a statistically relevant trajectory?”\n",

In fact, these furthest reaches of the climate pathways—the tips of the spaghetti—are the very ones that matter most for policy, says Richard Alley, a geoscientist at Penn State and the former chair of the National Research Council’s panel on abrupt climate change, who was also at the conference. By the time you get to the end of the century the greatest source of uncertainty derives from what we as a society do—or fail to do. The imprecision represents an opportunity, then: a chance to navigate a safer, flatter curve into the future. Put another way, by focusing exclusively on climate projections for the next few decades, where there isn’t much to argue over, Reilly’s plan enforces helplessness. “The shorter the window you worry about, the less you do to reduce emissions,” Alley says.\n",

It’s only by looking forward that one can spot the bigger dangers: The Fifth National Climate Assessment is due out in 2023, and if Trump is reelected, his Administration will get to shape what is arguably the most important policy document on climate change produced by the federal government.

If that’s surprising, it shows how tangled the politics of decarbonization has become.

Page channeled her anger into a new documentary based on Waldron’s work (and sharing its title), which examines the health impacts of environmental racism and the resistance efforts of affected communities. In the film, Page returns to Nova Scotia and talks to women leading the charge to restore their communities. They band together, for example, to prevent a company from building a natural-gas storage facility that would harm the Shubenacadie River, and to fight for the cleanup of Boat Harbour, a former aquatic hub for the Pictou Landing First Nation polluted by wastewater from a nearby pulp mill. “The level of cruelty in what I witnessed, in what these individuals have lived with, is disturbing and horrific,” says Page. “These issues are life or death, literally.” —Mahita Gajanan\n",

            "When it comes to transitioning the world off fossil fuels, “money talks,” says Anne Simpson, director of global governance at CalPERS, California’s public pension fund. Simpson should know. Her employer ranks among the world’s largest public funds, and she has used the sway that comes with -CalPERS’ more than $350 billion in investments to urge change. Early victories include pushing some of the world’s biggest companies to disclose the risk climate change poses to their businesses. To extend her reach, Simpson helps lead Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative to engage in behind-the-scenes negotiations to demand the world’s 100 biggest greenhouse—gas emitters change their ways. It’s prompted companies like mining giant Glencore to cap coal production and oil-and-gas major Shell to commit to emission-reduction targets. To Simpson, investor activism is simply good business sense. “There’s no business that can function without a healthy eco-system,” she says. —Justin Worland\n",

Young people across the world have followed her path, striking and marching to make clear to adults and decision-makers that this is a true emergency. “We are children saying, ‘Why should we care about our future when no one else is doing that? And why should we bother to learn facts when facts don’t matter in this society?’ When children say something like that, I think adults feel very bad,” Thunberg told TIME in April. In late August, she landed in the U.S. after a 15-day boat trip across the Atlantic, and she has plans for a months-long tour of the Americas—with a zero-carbon footprint. “This is an existential crisis that is going to affect our whole civilization, the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced,” she says. “I’m not planning to stop this movement, and I don’t think anyone else is either.” —Suyin Haynes\n",

Last year, her 11-acre project at Chulalongkorn University was Bangkok’s first new public park in 30 years and won awards for its innovative design, which adds much needed “green lungs” to a dense metropolis and absorbs and reuses excess water plaguing Thailand’s -capital—one of the locations most at risk from worsening storms, floods and sea-level rise. This year, she will open a 36-acre plot with the capability of storing more than 2.5 million gallons of water.

In 2017, the book Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming became a best seller. Wilkinson was the primary author. One of her guiding principles is the need to shift the climate-change discourse to “be more courageous and more emotionally intelligent,” she says, and the book is “about moving through what is hard and continuing to rise to the challenge.” Wilkinson recently co-hosted her own outdoor retreat, the Feminist Climate Renaissance, bringing together women from across sectors. “The climate crisis is also a leadership crisis,” she says, “and many women and girls are stepping in to fill that void and lead us forward … in a way that has not been the status quo in the climate movement.” —Suyin Haynes\n",

As she moved into business and advocacy, Wu learned fast, and her patient cajoling helped shepherd the rehabilitation of the world’s No. 2 economy from an environmental pariah to a champion of green issues on the global stage.

Over more than six decades, NASA has designed, built and launched spacecraft to observe Earth as it changes. Often working in concert with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which has primary responsibility for national weather forecasting, NASA runs satellites that measure ice sheets melting and carbon dioxide flowing through the atmosphere. The agency also flies aeroplanes to gather data about planetary change and funds a broad array of fundamental climate research, such as climate-modelling studies. “Our central role is in understanding how the Earth system is changing,” says St. Germain.\n",

Texas-based Exxon says three candidates nominated by a dissident group of shareholders had been elected to its board of directors. Preliminary tallies last week had two of the challengers winning seats. Nine of the 12-member board supported by Exxon were re-elected. The ouster is another blow as fossil fuel companies face growing pressure to re-focus their businesses. The hedge fund Engine No. 1 had asserted Exxon’s board was ill-equipped to handle the changing energy sector. The alternative slate of directors had the support of some of the largest money managers in the world.\n",

Other businesses, such as those in the aviation industry, have announced plans to purchase vast amounts of carbon offsets. Offsets have been plagued by issues of double-counting and shady accounting, which makes verification critical.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has become the fossil fuel industry’s primary answer to the climate crisis. The basic idea of CCS for a coal or gas plant is relatively simple, as the fuel is combusted, capture the carbon dioxide and store it somewhere to keep it from going into the atmosphere. The issues arise with economics and scale. Installing CCS technology would make many fossil fuel plants economically uncompetitive, especially as costs for solar and wind power continue to plummet. As a result, relatively few CCS-equipped plants have been built, and one of the largest, the Petra Nova gas plant, closed last year. Furthermore, to limit emissions, this technology would need to be deployed on a massive scale, with some estimates indicating we would need to open one new CCS plant per week (right now there are fewer than 30 worldwide). Storing tremendous quantities of carbon dioxide may be possible, but it poses major logistical challenges. Ironically, most of the carbon dioxide captured today goes into enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a method of using the compressed carbon dioxide to force out more fossil fuels from the ground.\n",

            "While CCS and hydrogen may play a constructive role in a low-carbon future, climate techno-fixes of “geoengineering” are potentially dangerous distractions. While geoengineering can refer to many different means of altering the environment (even planting trees), the geoengineering attracting Silicon Valley’s attention is far more controversial. Perhaps the most audacious proposal is that of solar radiation management (SRM), which increases the amount of incoming solar energy reflected back into space. From a technical standpoint, the idea is not terribly complex. When volcanoes erupt, they release sulfate particles into the high atmosphere. Human-produced aerosols have a similar effect, blocking some of the sun’s energy from reaching the Earth’s surface, thus cooling the planet. In a geoengineering scheme, massive amounts of sulfates would be released into the atmosphere to simulate this reflective effect. While this approach initially appears cost-effective, it represents nothing less than turning the planet into a giant experiment. Changing the global energy balance is likely to have negative effects on certain regions, ranging from increased floods to severe droughts. In addition, this “solution” does not address ocean acidification (often called global warming’s “evil twin”), as carbon dioxide levels continue to rise. Not only might sulfates increase pollution in the form of acid rain, but these short-lived atmospheric particles would need to be sprayed continually to maintain the desired temperature. Halting the experiment would lead to frighteningly rapid warming from the built-up greenhouse gases. SRM would be a diplomatic nightmare as nations fight over who gets to set the planetary thermostat and might detract from proven emissions reduction strategies. Geoengineering may create moral hazard by convincing people that emissions can continue indefinitely without consequences. While geoengineering may need to be considered as an emergency measure, its frightening unknown consequences make it a solution of last resort.\n",

Texas-based Exxon says three candidates nominated by a dissident group of shareholders had been elected to its board of directors. Preliminary tallies last week had two of the challengers winning seats. Nine of the 12-member board supported by Exxon were re-elected. The ouster is another blow as fossil fuel companies face growing pressure to re-focus their businesses. The hedge fund Engine No. 1 had asserted Exxon’s board was ill-equipped to handle the changing energy sector. The alternative slate of directors had the support of some of the largest money managers in the world.\n",

            "To review: Keystone XL, a project of the TransCanada Corporation (now TC Energy), was slated to carry oil from Alberta’s tar sands across the country to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. President George W. Bush approved the original Keystone pipeline, and it went into service, early in the Obama years, without any real fuss. A new XL version, announced in 2008, was larger and took a different course across the heartland. And, this time, there was opposition. It came first from indigenous people in Canada, who had watched tar-sand mines lay waste to a vast landscape. First Nations leaders, such as Melina Laboucan-Massimo and Clayton Thomas-Muller, along with Native-American leaders on this side of the border—including Tom and Dallas Goldtooth, of the Indigenous Environmental Network—put up strong resistance and joined forces with ranchers whose lands would be bisected by the pipeline. Organizers such as Jane Kleeb, in Nebraska, found small pockets of support within some of the “big green” environmental groups, much of it coördinated by the veteran campaigner Kenny Bruno. In the spring of 2011, the NASA climate scientist James Hansen helped orient the pipeline as a climate-related fight, pointing to the massive amounts of carbon contained in the Canadian tar-sand deposits and making the case that, if they were fully exploited, it would be “game over” for the climate. That brought the climate movement into the picture; a letter (full disclosure: I drafted it) went out in the summer of 2011, asking people to engage in civil disobedience outside the White House.\n",

            "At first, it wasn’t clear how many would do so, in part because President Barack Obama was popular with environmentalists. But people—many of them wearing Obama buttons—began arriving in serious numbers. Before two weeks of protest, starting in late August, were over, 1,254 people had been arrested, in one of the largest nonviolent direct actions in recent years. A few months later, many times that number circled the White House perimeter, standing shoulder to shoulder, five deep. The big environmental groups quickly joined the fight. Even so, the experts said that there was no chance to stop the pipeline. (The National Journal polled its “energy insiders,” and ninety-one per cent said that TransCanada would soon have its permit.) But, in fact, the battle was over by mid-November, when Obama announced a delay, in order to consider the question more closely. As he consolidated support for his reëlection bid, he had apparently concluded that “Keystone” and “climate” were too closely linked, though it took him several years to officially reject the permits. Ever since that initial pause, it’s been a matter of holding on to that victory—in close votes in Congress, during the Obama years, in endless wrangling with financiers, and with brilliant maneuvering in the courts, after Donald Trump revived the pipeline during his first days in office. I’m very grateful for Biden’s action, but I had no doubt he would take it—even today, Keystone is far too closely identified with climate carelessness for a Democratic President to be able to waver.\n",

There was already growing concern about global warming, and Keystone proved to be the catalyst for the rapid expansion of the climate movement, which was soon fighting for such things as fossil-fuel divestment and renewable portfolio standards for solar power. The events of 2011 also showed that the fossil-fuel industry was not unbeatable, and it encouraged people to oppose the construction of just about every new fracking well and coal port and liquid-natural-gas terminal. Environmentalists have won many of these infrastructure battles, and they’ve added delay and cost to projects. (Who knows how many bad things were never even proposed in the wake of Keystone XL?) The wins continue: last fall, after an inspired decade-long campaign led by Michigan environmentalists, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced that the state would close down a tar-sands pipeline through the Straits of Mackinac, in the heart of the Great Lakes. But there have been plenty of losses, too, and Biden will get to help decide the fates of two other critical projects that resemble KXL in many ways.\n",

The most important outcome of the Keystone XL fight was that Obama imposed a de-facto “climate test” on all new large-scale infrastructure projects that require federal approval—and, if you apply the most basic version of that challenge to either of these projects, they fail instantly. Pressure is already building on Biden to do something about them; a letter last week from seventy-five indigenous women leaders demanded the cancellation of all three pipelines. His response to the Dakota Access and Line 3 pipelines will likely depend on the shifting balance of power between environmentalists, indigenous groups, and organized labor.\n",

            "This surprises many people, who are used to thinking of the fossil-fuel industry as the main pressure group. But that industry is at its strongest during Republican Administrations. With Democrats in power, an equally important constituency is the building-trades unions of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., because they get the well-paid jobs involved in constructing these mega-projects; the unions were staunch proponents of Keystone XL from the start. (Jason Kenney, the premier of Alberta, has said repeatedly in recent months that he was counting on the unions to help TransCanada prevail in the endgame of the Keystone fight, not understanding American politics well enough to know that that particular ship had already sailed; it was as realistic as the company’s Onion-esque last-minute pledge to power the operation of the pipeline with renewable energy.) Line 3, for instance, is proceeding under Governor Walz, a Democrat, likely because it brings a lot of union jobs. “I got a lot of people who said that it’s been nearly a whole year since they went to work,” Royce Schulz, a union steward working on the project in Carlton County, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, in December. “It couldn’t have hit at a better time, to get people back on their feet and making money again.”\n",

            "A construction worker earning ninety thousand dollars is, correctly, a more sympathetic figure than an oil executive earning ten times that much. And labor is a key part of the progressive coalition. So, environmental activists (with rare exceptions, such as the always forthright Naomi Klein) have been reluctant to call out the building-trades unions, even when they offered Donald Trump their fulsome support in an effort to get projects like these approved. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. came out in favor of the Dakota Access pipeline in September of 2016, even after security guards used dogs against protesters. In response, the Labor Coalition for Community Action, which includes minority unionists, joined the Communication Workers of America, the nurses union, and other labor heavyweights to stand against the pipeline. The outcome of this fight within labor, and the wider progressive movement, will determine in large measure how aggressive Biden will be on climate-busting projects. If he allows the Dakota Access and Line 3 pipelines to proceed, he will dismay many core supporters, not to mention allow infrastructure that will be spewing carbon into the air for many decades to come. But perhaps this son of Scranton is uniquely positioned to solve this conundrum. What’s needed is a grand bargain, which replaces fossil-fuel-infrastructure jobs with jobs building solar panels, wind turbines, water pipes that don’t carry lead, and so on. These jobs need to be comparable in terms of pay; there has to be necessary retraining for workers; and someone has to figure out how to allocate this new work to existing unions, so that no one gets left out and that all kinds of Americans share in those jobs. It is, in other words, the messy work of a “just transition” that, in this moment of economic and climatic peril, can’t be dodged any longer.\n",

            "There are instructive and hopeful lessons from the past. For many years, the combined power of unions and auto companies insulated Detroit from federal action on automobile mileage. Barack Obama managed to break that deadlock shortly after taking office when, in return for federal bailouts, he forced the industry to agree to much higher fuel-efficiency standards. One of the people who cut that deal was a young aide to the national economic adviser named Brian Deese; he is now himself the national economic adviser. The rest of Biden’s climate team has solid labor credentials, too—for example, Gina McCarthy, the new domestic climate czar, was the head of the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama, where she helped implement the mileage regulations. As the legislative director of the United Auto Workers explained to Congress, “The continuing recovery of the automobile industry in the United States has as its foundation the regulatory certainty of these tailpipe-emission standards, which is driving innovation in every company and in every vehicle segment.” A few days before Biden’s Inauguration, the team sat down with labor leaders for a formal “listening session.” The official readout was anodyne, but the effort itself was promising—if Biden sticks to his stance that all policy is climate policy, then much can be done. Even Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat from West Virginia, who now may be the most powerful man in the Senate, given its fifty-fifty split, can perhaps be enticed with a series of proposals to cushion the irrevocable demise of the coal industry. Bernie Sanders now runs the Senate Budget Committee, which will have to look at any of these transition projects, and in the Senate he’s been both organized labor’s biggest booster and the most outspoken opponent of new fossil-fuel infrastructure.\n",

As those brackets denote, the precise target figure is up for negotiation, and the talks could see the overall framework watered down or enhanced, but an ambitious outcome could have a significant bearing on the outcome at the crucial COP26 Climate Summit, which is pencilled in to take place just a month later in Glasgow.
